"A few nights ago, my husband and I were watching an episode of Dragon's Den, the Canadian version of Shark Tank, and a ""social good"" company was pitching their Haitian recycling program. It was a bad business concept poorly executed, but it didn't justify one of the Dragons' responses, paraphrased below:
You're going about this the wrong way! You don't create a social good business before you become profitable. You become profitable by whatever means necessary, and then you give back! That's how business works.
Now, I'll concede that there's something to the idea that a business needs to be successful in order for a positive end to be achieved. But her response is not an unusual one in the business community, and more often than not, the American Sharks who invest in social enterprises also buy this ""the ends justifies the means"" argument. Put another way, business people as a rule - and no thanks to Capitalism - prioritize profit over social good. If some money can be thrown at a few noble causes at the end of the line, that's great. But do what you have to do to thrive, even if that means exploitation.
In an apparent attempt to combat that mindset, there are now hundreds of startup brands on the ""ethical"" market that use buzzwords like social enterprise, one-for-one, and give-back to describe themselves. One would presume by the marketing that being charitable makes a company ethical, and I've seen many ethical bloggers and influencers tout these brands as such, even when there's very little data on their supply chain. But it begs the question: can a company really be ethical if workers are not provided a living wage, if they're not working in a safe environment, and if no attention is paid to the sustainability of raw materials?
While give-back brands market themselves around the social good, how much good are they actually achieving? And is it enough?
Charitable small businesses believe that they are doing something different by placing a cause front and center in their marketing. But, on a practical level, if their supply chain isn't in order, they may not be doing much more than a conventional business. They may be even worse.
After all, those big, nasty corporations their marketing subtly critiques do the same thing.
Large corporations have a history of giving back. GE matches employees' charitable giving, Johnson & Johnson recently pledged 1 million dollars towards improving air quality around the world, and, since 2006, the BP Foundation has donated more than 218 million dollars to community initiatives around the country. Even Walmart, through its Foundation, awards grants and scholarships, and donates money in $200,000 lump sums to all sorts of relief efforts and deserving programs.
Being charitable is not a new angle. You could probably make the case that it's actually an engrained component of American enterprise, as fundamental as having a business plan. Americans really love charitable giving. In fact, in 2015 alone individual citizens and American businesses gave $373.25 billion dollars to charity.
You can look at this from a couple of perspectives. On the one hand, it's really nice to know that these hugely profitable enterprises are designating at least some of their profits to charitable giving. It's certainly better than nothing, and for the recipients of these pledges, scholarships, and funds, it can be life changing.
But it also makes it awfully convenient for these companies to never address problems in their supply chain - or even company culture within corporate offices - because as long as they claim they're being responsible, they can practically get away with murder (but, more realistically, with gross negligence when it comes to their most vulnerable workers).
So, when a nicely branded ""social enterprise"" tells me they give back, I have questions.
Where are your raw materials sourced? Who makes your product? Where? What's the wage? Have you visited your supplier? How did you choose your supplier, and why?
If they can't answer these questions with relative ease, something's wrong.
It's not that charity is bad. Charity is very good, and comes from good human emotions like empathy, love, and maybe a bit of guilt. Charity is what's needed in times of crisis - in famine, tsunami, and war.
But charity is also a bandaid placed on broken systems.
Charities, by their nature, go where there is trouble. Uprising, corruption, colonialism, exploitation, bigotry, terror. No amount of external aid, even if given in love and good faith, can correct underlying systemic issues. Sometimes, charity makes things worse.
The documentary, Poverty Inc., explores the ways in which charity has become big business, delaying permanent infrastructure and job development. In Haiti, NGOs are often so poorly managed that money simply vanishes, given to inefficient subcontractors or wasted on lavish homes.
After an earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010, Americans donated tens of millions of dollars to relief efforts. Haitian communities were inundated with donated rice, forcing local rice farmers to compete with free product, running many of them out of business. Meanwhile, an onslaught of solar panel donations threatened local alternative energy businesses. Even if individuals were helped in the short term, the local economy was now dependent on foreign aid to keep it afloat. Not only is this unsustainable, it's unethical.
Change happens when marginalized communities are empowered to transform systems of oppression into systems of flourishing.
Social good brands must realize that there are limits to charity, and that building a charitable business model without attention to the ethics of their supply chain or the long term efficacy of the nonprofits they support is both irresponsible and dangerous.
The best possible world is one in which charity no longer needs to exist because people are able to provide for their families and their communities. It is a place where individuals are valued and not exploited. Where the root causes of injustice are addressed before they can spiral out of control.
Charity is only good now because it is necessary. But the world we should be working toward is one where people are far too important to ever be turned into charity cases, where we don't get to feel good about giving.
Where we get to claim that we're good only when we know that everyone is being treated as the sacred beings they are.
In the words of John Wesley:
Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can.
So, businesses, by all means give to charity. But take it a step further by seriously scrutinizing your supply chain for the slightest sign of injustice and exploitation. Care about company culture. Care about the environment. Vet the charities you support. Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.
I originally covered this topic on my post on One-for-Ones. I'm hoping to do another post distinguishing between charity as a virtue versus ""charity, inc."" soon.",What are some of the potential negative impacts of charity as discussed in the context?,"The context discusses that charity can sometimes exacerbate problems rather than solve them. It can delay permanent infrastructure and job development, and in some cases, it can lead to mismanagement of funds. The context also mentions the situation in Haiti where an influx of donated rice and solar panels disrupted local businesses, making the local economy dependent on foreign aid. This is described as unsustainable and unethical. Furthermore, charity can also allow companies to overlook problems in their supply chain or company culture, as they can claim responsibility through their charitable actions."
"Game Notes EDM vs BUF
Buffalo Sabres (Head Coach: Dan Bylsma) at Edmonton Oilers (Head Coach: Todd McLellan)
NHL Game #31, Rogers Place, 2016-10-16 05:00:00PM (GMT -0600)
Sabres 6-2
Referees: Tim Peel, Brad Watson
Linesmen: Ryan Gibbons, Devin Berg
Three Stars: Ryan O’Reilly; Brian Gionta; Leon Draisaitl
- OK, look, I know we’re all disgusted at a big loss to a badly injured bottom feeder like Buffalo. But it’s important not to get overly caught up in the post facto narrative your brain is going to create as it looks through the lens of that putrid score.
- The truth is that the Oilers had a sh*t ton of great chances, and whiffed on a bunch of them. And the few they didn’t whiff on were mostly stopped.
- The Sabres on the other hand had fewer and less dangerous chances, but seemingly scored on all of them (and by my count, scored on three that weren’t really chances at all!)
- Make no mistake, these were two world-class tire fires going at it, and the Oilers have a lot to clean up, just as they did after the Flames victories. But the Sabres were by far the larger and stinkier of the two tire fires. Rewatch the game if you don’t believe me (I’m doing that right now to confirm my post game comments, and yes, it hurts a lot).
- The truth is, we see this kind of thing regularly – goaltending extremes will pretty much always override whatever happens with the rest of the team. What I mean by that is that great goaltending will overcome a huge deficit in play, and bad goaltending will torch a big advantage in play. And the latter is what happened tonight.
- What’s that old saying? “Goaltending is 50% of the game – unless you don’t have it, in which case it’s 100%”. Yup.
- On a side note, the reffing was horrific, as it always is when Tim Peel is soiling the ice with his presence. But that’s not why the Oilers lost.

In the third at 5 on 3 the point shot bounds off the boards and goes to six of net where Talbot pad stops it. This about the 6:50 mark.
Pretty sure that puck goes in. Even worse for Talbots night.
I wonder, are you able to get that clip? Talbots glove hides where the puck is and he slips it out.
Hmm, interesting. Let me take a look, I think I have a way to capture it as a clip if so
Yeah, I think I see what you mean around 7:00 left. it’s certainly possible it might have been over the line, but as you say, it looks like Talbot’s glove is covering it so can’t be called anyway. Of course, officials have disallowed an Oiler goal where it was visibly over the line and not covered, so I wouldn’t put it past them to call a covered puck a goal against!",Who were the three stars in the NHL game between Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers?,"The three stars were Ryan O’Reilly, Brian Gionta, and Leon Draisaitl."

"Wander round St Cézaire
Explore the picturesque hilltop town, stop for a café au lait or a leisurely lunch on the square, meet the locals playing boules, and soak up the Provencal atmosphere.
Follow the Siagne
As well as exploring the attractive village of St Cézaire on your doorstep, you could follow the river Siagne downstream to Auribeau, another pretty village which clings to the hillside. The Siagne meets the Mediterranean ocean at Mandelieu-la-Napoule, with its beach and marina, and a 14th century fortified castle which was renovated in the 1920s by an eccentric American couple - the sculptor husband renovated the interior whilst the architect wife applied her talents to the gardens. The castle and gardens are open for view every day, as well as hosting regular music and arts events.
Grasse
Grasse Cathedral, dedicated to Notre Dame du Puy and founded in the 11th century, is the town's most notable landmark and contains three works by Rubens and one by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, a painter who came from Grasse. Considered as the perfume capital of the world, scents waft from the prolific boutiques around town selling fragrances from Grasse's established perfumeries.
Hilltop villages
Take your pick from several picturesque villages perchés in the region, so called because they perch precariously on the hillside; Callian, Fayence, Seillans and Mons would make a pretty circuit for a leisurely afternoon's drive.
Lake Saint-Cassien
Kayak and pedalo hire are available to explore the lake, but a drive around is also very rewarding for its ever-changing views from different angles, with the opportunity to stop off for lunch at a waterside restaurant en route.
For art lovers...
.... take a trip to nearby Mougins which has become a draw to both artists and celebrities over the years. The artist Picasso also lived and painted here with the tourist office once being his studio. There are now many galleries to visit with the museum of classical art also being present.
The Riviera
The beaches, marinas and chic boutiques of the French Riviera are easily accessible, around half an hour's drive away, with the nearest resort being Cannes-Mandelieu. The breaktaking scenic drive along the beautiful Estérel coastline is also a must-do.
The Verdon Gorge
Head northwest into the Var region to see the spectacular gorge, 25km long and 700 metres deep, formed by the Verdon river whose mineral deposits turn it a startling turquoise. Take a day to drive around the hairpin bends above the canyon, go walking or climbing in the National Park, or even hire kayaks to explore the waterways.
Hit Cannes!
If you enjoy a bit of retail therapy whilst on holiday, drive down to the shopaholic's mecca, Cannes, to seek out the designer labels. Combine with a spot of lunch at one of the many restaurants and a stroll along the famous Croisette.
Antibes makes for a lovely day out...
It has lovely sandy beaches, great restaurants and ice creams shops, and an attractive old quarter to wander round. There is also the port to explore, and landmarks such as the Cathedral and the fortress. A big attraction in the town is the Picasso Museum, which looks out over the sea and contains not only paintings but ceramics and drawings by the great artist.
Take cookery lessons
at Les Apprentis Gourmets in Cannes. Learn to cook authentic cuisine française!
Monkeying around!
'Canyon Forest' in Villeneuve-Loubet offers a treetop adventure course that kids (and energetic adults) will love, involving rope swings, nets, bridges etc in the trees. Minimum age is 8 years old and minimum height 1.3m tall. For smaller children, 'Pitchoun Forest' near Villeneuve-Loubet offers an easier course suitable for children as young as 3.
Family day out
Espace Marineland, just outside of Antibes, is a marine park with over 4000 animals, including a tropical reef aquarium, a shark tunnel, polar bears and penguins, and shows of sea lions, orcas and dolphins. On the same site, there is also the Aquasplash water park, the ‘Far West’ theme park and Adventure Golf. Plus plenty of play areas, picnic spots and restaurants.
Venture to Nice
The capital of the French Riviera, Nice, is about an hour's drive from this property. As well as offering a wealth of culinary delights at the many restaurants and cafés that line the sun-soaked streets, this vibrant city is a feast for the senses with its daily markets offering an abundance of flowers, local produce and Provençal crafts. In addition, the city is a must-visit for cultural enthusiasts, with over twenty museums and galleries, and was home and inspiration to the world famous modernist artist Henri Matisse for over 30 years.

NEW YORK (CBSMiami) – While more traditional styles of women’s underwear dominate the market, a number of independent brands are catering to a much larger market.
At the New York headquarters of Lively, the unmentionables on display aren’t necessarily meant to be kept under wraps.
“These styles look like you could wear them outside, not just under your clothes,” said Karina Mitchell.
“And they’ve certainly been styled that way,” Alexandra Alquiza responded.
Underwear is big business, and Victoria’s Secret has helped shape the industry.
According to IBIS World, in 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, known for its enticing looks, accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. retail lingerie market.
But Lively’s director of marketing, Alexandra Alquiza, says a growing number of women want something different.
“Ultimate comfort coupled with high style… really tapping into a new definition of sexy,” she said. “The sexy that resonates with women today is around being active and outgoing and confident.”
Athleticwear has taken off and is now finding its way into intimate apparel.
More businesses are creating a diverse range of undergarments that include larger sizes, increased comfort and styles that can blur the lines..
People who stopped by the label’s New York photo shoot seemed interested.
“I really like the more flexible casual look,” one person said.
Another person added, “As long as it’s comfortable and gives you support, that’s all that matters to me.”","What percentage of the U.S. retail lingerie market did L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, account for in 2016?","In 2016, L-Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. retail lingerie market."

Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.

We will remember them.”

"In the Tivoli Storage Manager environment where many nodes try to initiate scheduled operations simultaneously, you may need to manage scheduling throughput wisely in-order to make sure the TSM server does not get into network bottleneck. You can choose a different scheduling mode options for some schedules based upon the priority and available resources, and you can control how often client nodes contact the server to perform a scheduled operation.
Relation between SCHEDMODE and SERVERINITIATION parameters
Tivoli Storage Manager provides two scheduling modes - client-polling and server-prompted. The mode indicates how client nodes interact with the server for scheduling operations. With client-polling mode, client nodes poll the server for the next scheduled event. With server-prompted mode, the server contacts the nodes at the scheduled start time.
By default, the server permits both scheduling modes. The default (ANY) allows nodes to specify either scheduling mode in their client options files. You can modify this scheduling mode.
Also Read: How to configure TSM Client Backup & Archive Schedules ?
Also Read: How to configure TSM Client Backup & Archive Schedules ?
If you modify the default server setting to permit only one scheduling mode, all client nodes must specify the same scheduling mode in their client options file. Clients that do not have a matching scheduling mode will not process the scheduled operations. The default mode for client nodes is client-polling. The scheduler must be started on the client node's machine before a schedule can run in either scheduling mode.
By default, clients contact the server (client-polling scheduling mode and SESSIONINITIATION=CLIENTORSERVER). If SESSIONINITIATION is set to the default CLIENTORSERVER value, you can use either client-polling or server-prompted scheduling modes. The client might start sessions with the server by communicating on the TCP/IP port that was defined with a server option. Server-prompted scheduling also can be used to prompt the client to connect to the server.
You can instead prevent clients from starting sessions, and allow only the server to start sessions with clients. To limit the start of backup-archive client sessions to the server only, do the following steps for each node
- Use the REGISTER NODE command or the UPDATE NODE command to change the value of the SESSIONINITIATION parameter to SERVERONLY, Specify the high-level address and low-level address options. These options must match what the client is using, otherwise the server will not know how to contact the client.
- Set the scheduling mode to server-prompted. All sessions must be started by server-prompted scheduling on the port that was defined for the client with the REGISTER NODE or the UPDATE NODE commands.
- Ensure that the scheduler on the client is started. You cannot use the client acceptor (dsmcad) to start the scheduler when SESSIONINITIATION is set to SERVERONLY.
If you modify the default so that the server permits only one scheduling mode for the server, all clients must specify the same scheduling mode in their client options file. Clients that do not have a matching scheduling mode do not process scheduled operations.
To have clients poll the server for scheduled operations, run this command on TSM Server
set schedmodes polling
Ensure that client nodes specify the same mode in their client options files.
To have the server prompt clients for scheduled operations, run this command on TSM Server
set schedmodes prompted
Ensure that client nodes specify the same mode in their client options files.
To return to the default scheduling mode so that the server supports both client-polling and server-prompted scheduling modes, run this command on TSM Server
set schedmodes any
Client nodes can then specify either polling or prompted mode. Modifying the default scheduling mode on client nodes Users can set the scheduling mode on client nodes. They specify either the client-polling or the server-prompted scheduling mode on the command line or in the client user options file. (On UNIX and Linux systems, root users set the scheduling mode in the client system options file.

"How to know if you’re in love? 10 tips
Is it just a passing phase, is it a serious infatuation or this time, is it the real thing? If you can’t figure out whether what you’re feeling really is love, then it’s time to do a little soul searching and ask yourself these ten questions to find out what you’re really feeling:
1. Can you picture a future without him?
Whatever your plan is for the future, our first tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – ask yourself this question: is it him in every picture that you have those future plans with? If he’s there at your side in all your dreams of travel, children and even your career, then you must be getting pretty serious about this guy.
2. Can you discuss anything with him?
Do you feel comfortable opening up to him? If you feel that you can tell him anything, even your innermost fears and secrets, then you are on the right track. When you’re willing to be completely open and honest with someone and you trust them enough to tell them about the mistakes that you have made in the past, then you are probably in love. If everything you say is designed to impress him, though, then you may not be quite there yet.
3. Do you feel good about yourself when you’re with him?
Our next tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – if you are truly in love with a person, then being around them will bring out the best in you. Love means that you want to be with that person for the rest of your life, so he should make you feel like you can really achieve things and go places with him at your side.
4. Does he make you laugh?
At times, life can be tough enough without being miserable as well, so you need a bit of laughter in a relationship. If he makes you laugh and you can laugh comfortably with each other, then that shows you that you are at the same wavelength and comfortable enough in each other’s company to be in love.
5. Can you be yourself when you are with him?
Another good tip on how to know if you’re in love is this – if you are really in love, then you shouldn’t need to a put an act, when you’re around him. You should feel comfortable enough to let the true you come out. If you don’t feel relaxed enough to be yourself, then it is unlikely that this is true love.
6. Do you ever run out of things to talk about?
Everything seems interesting, fun and easy, when you are in love and when you’re talking to the love of your life about things. You can always tell, if a couple is really loved up by the way that they are always talking to each other. Awkward silences are not a sign of a loving couple.
7. Would you look after them if they were unwell?
Now be honest about this question, because it really can be a telling one. Some illnesses need a lot more care, than just mopping the brow and some soothing words, sometimes illness can be really messy! Would you look after him, when he got a flu?
8. Do his flaws still annoy you?
Another great tip on how to know if you’re in love is to ask yourself this question: does he do things that really bug you? If you love someone, then you love them wholeheartedly and that includes their little imperfections. If there are things that he does now, that really get under your skin, then you do need to ask yourself how much you love this person. It’s unlikely that you will get him to change his ways, and if it really was love, then you wouldn’t want him to change anyway.
9. Do you admire him? Are you proud of him?
Next question on how to know if you’re in love is this: are you proud to be seen with him and do you admire him? If you are, then that’s a good sign, because when you love someone you are proud of them and their achievements, and you love to show off your admiration and pride about them.
10. Do you value his opinion?
And finally, another tip on how to know if you’re in love is to find out the answer to this question: do you really care about what he thinks? You shouldn’t have to do things just to impress him, but you should care what he thinks. Love means that you want that special person in your life to be happy and you will go out of your way to make that happen, because he makes you happy too.
How do you know you love someone? Please, feel free to share your tips in the comment section below.
Stay happy!",What are some signs that you might be in love with someone?,"Some signs that you might be in love with someone include picturing a future with them, feeling comfortable discussing anything with them, feeling good about yourself when you're with them, they make you laugh, you can be yourself around them, you never run out of things to talk about, you would look after them if they were unwell, their flaws don't annoy you, you admire them and are proud of them, and you value their opinion."
"(JollofNews) – Prof.’
Thus, the intellectual has a pride of place in the development of a country, in theorising and shaping its policy direction. Plato assigned such a role to his ‘philosopher-king’. If the ruler is not a ‘philosopher-king’ or does not have the ‘intellect’, then he or she is expected to surround himself or herself with men and women of intellect to help in such an endeavour.
Certainly, directing policy decisions or being able to engage in their formulation would require a greater understanding of their intricacies and complexities and simplifying them for effective implementation. Our policy and decision makers, at the administrative, military, academic, judicial, financial and economic levels, by virtue of their interaction with ideas which they formulate into policy directions, in my view will also fall under the category ‘intellectuals’, they play such a role. Our religious lives are also greatly influenced by the intellectuals in that realm. The ‘influencers’ at these levels are who I refer to, for want of a better term, as ‘intellectuals’.
What has been the role of the home-based intellectual in our liberation struggle from the clutches of Jammehism? Were they at the forefront of citizenship, of the fight against the dictatorship, of holding the Government accountable, of speaking truth to power, actively and courageously? Were they relevant? Did they rise up to the occasion when we needed them; when Jammeh and his group of brigands and murderers were running amok and playing dice with our lives? What role did our intellectuals play in our fight for liberation, for justice, in the 22 years we were under the Wellington boots of one man?
Granted that the government was a tyranny and shouted down all voices of dissent from within. It held the sword of Damocles around everyone’s neck. Our intellectuals gave what the Government wanted, subservience and sycophancy. They were, by and large, uninterested in local politics and in the lives and challenges of the other half, the worker and farmer in the backwaters.
It is fair to indicate, though, that there were strident voices of dissent from few of our intellectuals from in-country and the diaspora. There were men and women, outside the circle of Government, who had the courage of their conviction, spoke against tyranny and suffered privation, imprisonment and callous death. But these local voices were lonely and betrayed and they faced instances where their fellow intellectuals, instead of showing solidarity and ‘unionism’, pooh-poohed them as ‘trouble makers’ or their acts of sacrifice as foolhardy and cheap.
The Jammeh carrot and stick method, at once seductive and menacing, proved effective. Our intellectuals, I speak of the majority here, in both the public and private sectors, metamorphosed into sycophants and ‘praise singers’. They lost their capacity to speak truth to power. Instead of puncturing and demystifying the ‘myth’ that Yaya created around him, the false clairvoyance, they provided the prop for it, explaining it away and amplifying and glorifying it for the people to buy into it.
Through patronage, the loyalty of many intellectuals were bought and once they became ‘yoked to power’, they could not speak out. Through co-option, most of them became the mouthpiece of the tyranny. Through self-censorship, they could not provide the critical support and leadership that the down-trodden masses needed during those critical times. They knew he was a charlatan and a quack, yet our intellectuals praised him in his folly and ignorance. They admitted him into the circle of intellectuals and endorsed his ‘ideologies’, eccentric, idiosyncratic and incoherent, which were used to drive our development agenda. There were even some intellectuals who wrote or speak fawningly about Jammeh and his development strides’ even though it was clear these were hoisted on the petard of their own opportunism.
Defeating an entrenched dictatorship of 22 years, through the powers of people armed with nothing but a marble, and not the pen and the gun, is indeed a revolutionary act. But it is a revolution which should be perpetual- there is an ongoing struggle at the center of the earth between good and evil. We cannot be complacent or rest on our laurels because we have defeated a dictator. There are many other dictators lurking in the background, ready to take center stage if the people let their guards down; ready to dole out favours or prime themselves as the ‘saviours’ and become the new dictators.
In this new dispensation, our intellectuals must play the role expected, of providing leadership and critical advice regarding the consolidation of the freedom we have won for ourselves, contributing to the development of ideas and constructing intellectual frameworks that would guide national debates. They must distinguish themselves by their courage to stand for what is best for the country, not by their ‘silence, submission and subservience’, be defenders and protectors of human rights, and, when necessary, speak truth to power. When an intellectual has the chance to speak out against injustices, and yet remain silent, he or she contributes to the moral paralysis and intellectual barrenness of the country.
Academic freedom we should fight for and the University of The Gambia, our premier citadel of learning, should rekindle such intellectual debates. Our intellectuals must insist on autonomy, demanding autonomous spaces for intellectual activities and seizing it if need be. They must reconnect with the masses and remain, as Samir Amin averred, in ‘living and close communion with the popular classes, to share their history and cultural expression’. It cannot anaesthetise itself from the ills of society and remain a happy, fulfilled class.
Regardless the role our intellectuals will be playing, I think that if we truly want to preserve the fundamental values of a democratic society, then all of us must display a certain degree of vigilance, be willing to take responsibility for what we do or fail to do, fulfill our role as active citizens, be ready to be accountable and to hold others accountable without fear or favour, scrutinize both the intent and actions of the State and be ready to stand for the truth no matter who it will hurt.
We should endeavor to know what obligations are placed on the Government, what standards it must meet and who should be held accountability for the fulfillment of our rights. Without the understanding of the obligations of the Government vis-à-vis the citizens, and the duties and sovereign powers that citizens have, we will not be able to hold our Government accountable or stand for our rights when they are violated or denied or just partly fulfilled.",What role should intellectuals play in a new dispensation according to the context?,"In a new dispensation, intellectuals should provide leadership and critical advice regarding the consolidation of freedom, contribute to the development of ideas and construct intellectual frameworks that guide national debates. They should stand for what is best for the country, defend and protect human rights, and speak truth to power when necessary. They should also insist on autonomy for intellectual activities and reconnect with the masses."
"When I try, I get a message asking me to download/try Premiere Elements 10.
At the time that I ordered and downloaded Elements 10 the Adobe 'Live Chat'person told me that Elements 10 was backward compatible with Premiere Elements 4: that it WOULD allow me to use 4.
Any suggesstions, please.
Premiere Elements projects aren't even remotely backward compatible, Chik. It's impossible to open a newer version project with an older version of the program. Sorry. (It's also dangerous to try to open an older version project with a newer version of the program, by the way.)
It's best to finish your work in the project you started it.
I don't think you understand.
I have Photoshop Elements 10. I want to send my slide shows to Premiere Elements 4.
I had Photoshop Elements 6 and I had no problem sending slideshows to Premiere Elements 4.
Before I upgraded to Photoshop Elements 10, I was told (by Adobe LiveChat) that I could do the same thing from Photoshop Elements 10... and send my slideshows to Premiere Elements 4.
Was I mislead?
Yep. Sorry.
Premiere Elements 4 and Photo Elements 6 are a set. They talk to each other. (After Premiere Elements 4, Adobe made Premiere Elements and Photo Elements releases the same version number to avoid confusion.) Using the Organizer in Photo Elements 4, you can send your slideshow to Premiere Elements 4. (Technically, your slideshow is coming from the Organizer, not Photo Elements.)
Open the Organizer from Premiere Elements 10. This is the version 10 Organizer. It WILL port your slideshow to Premiere Elements 10 if you select the Send to Premiere Elements option. (Though do make sure your photos are no larger than 1000x750 pixels.)
I don’t HAVE Premiere Elements 10.
I have Premiere Elements 4 .
When I dealt with Live Chat that is why I enquired about compatibility with Premiere Elements 4.
If I had been told that Photoshop Element 10 (with Organizer) was NOT compatible with Premiere Elements 4; I would not have bought, it and instead would have considered purchasing the ‘bundled’ Photoshop Elements 10/Premiere Elements 10 combination…. But I was told the opposite so (in order to save some money) I purchased the stand-alone Photoshop 10.
If you are an Adobe representative, please email me, I will give you the order number, and forward a copy of the ‘Live Chat’ conversation and perhaps we can discuss a solution.
Thanks

2009 Privilege 495 - Never Chartered, Circumnavigation Ready
After having circumnavigated 15 years ago on another well-known make of catamaran, my wife and I felt the Privilege 495 had the perfect blend of comfort and speed to introduce our 10-year old daughter to the life of cruising.
We purchased Dragonfly from the original owners in Australia in January 2016, and planned to spend 1 year cruising the Queensland Coast, but after settling in and enjoying our time onboard Dragonfly, we decided to extend our trip and explore the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Having stretched our sabbatical past our initial deadline, we've decided it's now time to find Dragonfly a new owner.
We are the second owners of Dragonfly, a 2009 Privilege 495. She is in very good condition and has never been chartered.
Dragonfly's layout is galley up, with a spacious master cabin with large en suite. There are three additional cabins, two with en suites.
Dragonfly is fully equipped with features including a 7kVA Onan Cummins genset, 100L/H water maker, Sovereign stainless steel BBQ, bow sprit with gennaker, 40kg/88lb Rocna Vulcan anchor, two 54hp Yanmar engines, and much, much more.
Dragonfly is solidly built (Category A / Ocean-Going - ""designed for sailing, under normal conditions of use, in wind forces exceeding 8 on the Beaufort scale""), with a high attention to design and comfort, which makes passage making or at anchor relaxing and pleasurable.
Dragonfly is currently in the Phuket/Langkawi area. We are still living aboard so she is completely turn-key for anyone interested in setting sail immediately.
Serious inquiries only please.
Navigation Systems

"Dulce de Leche Chocolate Chip Ice Cream is the perfect summer treat. 3 ingredients and 5 minutes is all it takes to make this no churn frozen dessert!
My sister and her boyfriend visited us two weeks ago. Now he loves desserts so I wanted to make something he would truly enjoy. I was considering baking for a second but then I decided against. Too hot! The weather was way too hot for baking.
So I made no bake chocolate biscuit cake and Dulce de Leche chocolate chip ice cream instead.
I love Dulce de Leche! This thick and creamy caramel sauce can be used for anything really: a cake filling, cupcake frosting, mousse… No matter where you use it, you will be in for a treat!
Take this Dulce de Leche chocolate chip ice cream. I added thick caramel sauce to whipped cream, mixed and stirred in chocolate chips for some crunchiness. Guys, it literally took 5 minutes to make. You only need a mixer and an air-tight container! Plus a bowl where you mix everything together. That is it!
This ice cream is creamy, rich in flavor and has a nice crunch to it. You can eat it shortly after you have taken it from the freezer which is great, isn’t it? Because who wants to wait for an ice cream to thaw first before scooping it out from the container?
Not me! In fact, I am not a patient person so waiting for something always drives me super crazy! You know how it is: I want it and I want it now! By the way, I prefer eating this caramel chocolate chip ice cream with a spoon rather than licking it on a cone. What about you guys? Are you a cone or spoon person?
By the way, you can add more (or less) chocolate chips and the same goes for Dulce de Leche. The latter can also be substituted with caramel.
Dulce de Leche Chocolate Chip Ice Cream is the perfect summer treat. 3 ingredients and 5 minutes is all it takes to make this no churn frozen dessert!
- 1 Cup Heavy Cream
- ½ Cup Dulce de Leche
- ¼ Cup Chocolate Chips
- In a bowl, whip heavy cream. Add Dulce de Leche and mix until smooth.
- Stir in chocolate chips and pour into a 17 oz container.
- Cover with lid and freeze until set (5+ hours, best overnight).
- Enjoy!

"Kevin and I have been friends for many years and share a lot of similar passions for Christ and His community. As many of you know Kevin is one of the leading worship leaders in the Body of Christ and has been a mentor to many young bands including Delirious. Kevin is starting a new venture by launching the Music Coope. Rather than me taking the time to explain it I asked Kevin to do it in his own words. I encourage you check out his website and keep up with the new music that will be launched from the Music Coope.
What is the Music Coope?
Musicians have always been a cagy crew. Typically narcissistic and brooding, they are relentlessly in pursuit of euphoric inspiration that conjures heroic sensations usually reserved for superheroes and floating spacemen. Biblical accounts paint their origins in a rather suspect shade. Lucifer, the original angel of music who’s very being was interwoven with pipes and strings, was so intoxicated with ambition that he was cast down from the heavens. Jubal is the name of the first recorded musician passed down from the Hebrew oral tradition. No surprise that he is descendent from the infamous Cain who slew his brother Abel in a fit of jealous rage. When questioned by God about the whereabouts of Abel, Cain’s calloused response went something like this: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” The Music Coope is a family of musicians dedicated to being their brother’s (or sister’s) keeper. “Survival of the fittest” loses its’ intellectual glory when applied to human relationships. The Coope is about cooperation, believing artists will render their purest and best work in the context of community.
Founder and leading visionary of The Music Coope, Kevin Prosch, has a vision that harkens back to the Great Depression era. Prosch says: “Many farmers fell on desperate times in those days and for most the only means for survival was to form cooperatives, or Co-ops.” Farmers found strength and stability in pooling their financial and intellectual resources and many families and farms were rescued from abject poverty. Music Coope artists are using these same principles to create, promote and release their music while intentionally breaking down communication barriers between artists and their fans. Rather than selling out to an industry that has little regard for the artist apart from bottom-line production, Music Coope members are sowing into integrity based relationships with each other and fans of their work while creating a market place that is less “hustle” with more “flow”. Prosch says: “At the end of the day these artists are real people with families that have tangible needs just like every other human being. The Music Coope allows them to make an honest living in their craft while fans find themselves privy to an insiders look at the creative process of music making and intimate portraits of the artists themselves.” The first annual Music Coope Festival will be held June 9-11 in Amarillo, Texas. Registration information (registration discounts) and Festival details can be found at.
The Music Coope website will launch shortly and will offer fans an opportunity of membership at a very low monthly cost. Benefits will include free monthly downloads; free annual compilation CD featuring Coope artists, video diaries and interviews with Coope artists and monthly newsletters.",What is the purpose of the Music Coope?,"The Music Coope is a family of musicians dedicated to being their brother’s (or sister’s) keeper.

"MEET the kinder, gentler Larry Clark. Sure, his “Wassup Rockers” contains shots of teen flesh – most notably barechested boys in boxers – but the lurid violence, sex and nudity of “Kids” (rated NC-17), “Bully” and “Ken Park” are missing.
“Wassup Rockers,” out Friday, follows the antics of Jonathan, Kico, Milton, Porky, Eddie, Louie and Carlos – young Latino skakeboarders from Los Angeles’ South Central ghetto (much like the firsttime actors who play them) who take a trip to posh Beverly Hills, where they’re hassled by cops and picked up by rich white girls. The movie is partially based on the real lives of its actors.
Some say “Wassup Rockers” is tamer and more sentimental than your other films.
I think it just reflects the kids’ lives. This is just what happened, this is the story. These are good kids, and I want to show what they’re like.
Where did you find them?
It was pure serendipity.
“Ken Park” was opening in Paris and this French magazine asked me to take some photographs in California of Tiffany Limon [his much, much, younger lover, and a star of “Ken Park”] with some of the other actors, but they weren’t around.
So we went down to Venice to find some skate kids. And there were Porky and Kico; they were 14 or 15. They were really raggedy, their shoes were falling apart and their clothes were much too little for them and they had long hair. But they had style.
We photographed them for four days. A couple months later, when I took the magazine back to them, they wanted to go skating. I ended up taking them skating every Saturday for over a year.
How much of “Wassup Rockers” is real?
The first half of the film reflects their lives in South Central, and all those stories are their stories. I didn’t make those up at all.
The second half of the film I made up.
I started thinking, what would happen if I took them into Beverly Hills and they were picked up by some white girls, and their boyfriends came and there was this fight. That was the inspiration.
What are the boys doing now?
They’re going to high school.
Do they want to be actors?
I think they’d go with the flow. Kico is a great little natural actor – who knew? I kept giving him more and more to do. I’m writing another film for him and Jonathan.
Do the kids like the movie?
They’re happy. It’s really opened up the world for them. They’re poor ghetto kids whose world was a few square blocks of South Central. Now things are happening for them.
Are they celebrities in their own world?
A little bit. Plus when the film comes out, everybody’s going to know them.
Did the Beverly Hills cops give you a hard time, the way they do the skaters in “Wassup Kids”?
The Beverly Hills skate scene with the cop actually happened with us. The gang had never been to Beverly Hills, so I took them there one morning.
They start skating, and we get busted. The cop looked just like Robert Patrick from “Terminator 2: Judgment Day.”
Are you a skateboarder?
I learned how to skate when I was in my 40s, just before I made “Kids.” I hurt myself a lot, but I can skate a little.","What is the movie ""Wassup Rockers"" based on?","The movie ""Wassup Rockers"" is partially based on the real lives of its actors, who are young Latino skateboarders from Los Angeles’ South Central ghetto.

"Moses' Prophecy of Messiah
Jesus as the Prophet like unto Moses
by John J. Parsons
Like the patriarch Joseph before him, Moses was a ""picture"" of Yeshua in various significant ways. Though he was a Jew from the tribe of Levi, he appeared as a ""prince of Egypt"" to his own people and was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians (Acts 7:22). And though he was God's chosen deliverer, Moses was initially rejected by the Israelites and then turned to the Gentiles, taking a ""foreign"" bride. After being severely tested in the desert, he was empowered by God's Spirit to become Israel's deliverer for their hour of great tribulation. Indeed, both Moses and Yeshua were ""sent from a mountain of God"" to free Israel. Both revealed the meaning of God's Name; both spoke with God ""face to face."" Moses was sent from (physical) Mount Sinai in Midian; Yeshua was sent from a spiritual ""Mount Zion"" in Heaven (Heb. 12:22). The New Testament relates that Moses and Elijah later met with Yeshua to discuss His ""departure,"" literally, ""His Exodus"" (τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ) that he would accomplish at Jerusalem to redeem the entire world (Luke 9:30-31).In the Torah, Moses foretold of the coming Messiah who would resemble him in many prodigious ways:
The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you,from your brothers - it is to him you shall listen. (Deut. 18:15)
This verse is the only place in the entire Torah where Moses explicitly identifies himself as a prophet of the LORD. Moreover, this is also the only passage where Moses identifies the coming of the Messiah as ""a Prophet like me"" (Deut 18:15; John 6:14). In the New Testament we read that the soferim (scribes) had sent a delegation to question Yochanon the Immerser (John the Baptist), asking him two questions:
We further read that when Philip encountered Nathanael, he said, ""We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote - Yeshua minetzaret ben Yosef (Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph)"" (John 1:45). After Yeshua).Yeshua is the ""Prophet Like Unto Moses""In light of these passages of Scripture, here are thirty (30) ways in which Yeshua minetzeret ben Yosef indeed resembled Moses:
How, then, was Jesus a Prophet ""like Moses""?.
For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me: for he wrote of me - John 5:46

"Hey guys, I know I’ve been a little slow to post lately, but I hope to correct this. haha
So I was lucky enough to win this gorgeous little point and shoot over the recent Christmas holidays thanks to Camera House! I was very stoked and have to give a big shout out and thanks to them. Check them out on their Facebook page:
It arrived last Friday after much anticipation from myself and I was eager to go out and give it a shoot, and I thought why not give it a little review while I am at it. After charging the battery I flicked through the menu and had a quick play with settings. It is rather basic but I found by setting it to P mode I could at least set the ISO I wanted myself, rather than rely on the camera. I was also happy to see that in the colour settings other than Fuji Color and Black and white, they had a FujiChrome emulator which I look forward to playing with, this is supposed to emulate their famed slide film colours, I stuck with standard Fuji colour for this test. I also set the camera to center point focus as I find this beneficial to nailing the shots I want. The camera was setup and I was off to run it through it’s paces.
Before I go through my thoughts and shots, I suppose I best list it’s specs:

I went straight to the backyard and snapped this shot of this orange/red flower. Now I know this is not the best shot, however it is a good test of how the camera handles reds and oranges as I find many cameras/lenses struggle with these colours, often over saturating. I found it performed rather well in this department. However it is very touch and go, and could be prone to over saturation.
(this image has been cropped)
The next thing I wanted to test was focus speed. So I grabbed my youngest dog baby doll and got a quick snap of her. The focus seemed fine and snappy. The B&W setting seemed quite nice too.
The center point focus also seemed like the focus point was fine enough to pick up fine objects as the desired point of focus. I did however note that being used to my sony nex’s that it would greatly benefit from a tilt screen, however at around $100 retail. This camera is still quite a steal.
(this is image is cropped)
The zoom does seem quite adequate and is rather quick to zoom to the longer end. It doesn’t seem to lose too much sharpness at the long end either. I was able to snap this shot sitting in a cafe quite a way away from this couple with a dog. The 25-200mm zoom is quite handy and rather good for a camera in this class.
The close focusing distance of 5cm is also very good for a camera in the class and price range and the lens still remains sharp. I feel this could be very good for those that love to play with a little macro work, getting those shots of those little bugs. haha
I did however note that there is some slight barrel distortion. Which will only really be noticed when shooting horizons… or brick walls. But again, quite adequate for a camera in this class.
One thing that did strike me upon editing these pics from the camera (basic contrast and re-size) is how ‘filmic’ the images look due to that great little CCD sensor. This is something you will not find in a CMOS sensor camera as they definitely have more of a digital look too them. I must admit I was looking forward to the possibility of this as I am also an avid film shooter and was definitely not disappointed.
I enjoyed the look so much from this nifty little light point and shoot here are a few more images from my little test walk I took it for:
So after basically putting it through it’s paces, I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with this nifty little point and shoot and can see it accompanying me in my car often when I choose not to bother taking my DSLR’s. About the only thing I could have asked for more out of it was the ability to shoot raw…but then I did not pay for it, I won it thanks to Camera House. haha
All in all this is a very good performing, simple little camera, more than capable of taking some great shots if desired and definitely worth grabbing around the $100 mark if you are looking for a new point and shoot, or like me just a carry around camera when the Mrs tells you to leave the cameras at home. haha
I hope you have enjoyed this little review, till next time, Happy Snapping guys! 🙂",What are some of the specifications of the camera that the author won from Camera House?,"The camera has a CCD sensor with 13.8 Megapixels and light sensitivity of 1,600 ISO. It has an LCD screen of size 2.7"" and a resolution of 230k dots. The lens has a zoom of 8x, with a wide angle of 25 mm and a telephoto of 200 mm. The camera weighs 129 g and does not have interchangeable lenses. It supports video format of 720p @ 30fps and has a built-in flash. The storage supports formats like SD, SDXC, and SDHC."
"Back with a bang
I should never have doubted or even felt a shred of apprehension about Bloc Party‘s studio return after a four year hiatus. Kele Okereke’s solo asides were much less than stellar but thankfully his experimental excursions seem to have benefited the band tremendously rather than hinder it.
By the time I was a fan, roughly around late 2008, opinions had already formed and solidified about their three albums and supposed progressive downfall. I went into all of them with no real expectations and was totally unaware of the growing discontent with the band’s direction. Perhaps my blissful ignorance of the critical and public incense was a factor in my near equal enjoyment and appreciation of each record’s intricacies.
Bloc Party had never let me down before, and they still haven’t. Four is a collection of songs that are lucky to exist when you consider the band’s recent history; tensions supposedly having reached boiling point after Intimacy, rumors of the search for a new singer. Four‘s name, aside from the most obvious numeral significance, seems to have another meaning; this isn’t an album that gives the impression of being dictated by one person but rather, feels like more of a team effort (yes, they are four members in the band); granted, the lyrics are still classic Okereke, which is perfectly fine considering I’ve always enjoyed his writing (it’s mostly great here, once again) but instrumentally, the album doesn’t contain a shred of the rather poor fitting electronica he’s indulged in over the past few years, that particular itch having been scratched with his solo work. (and don’t get me wrong, such elements have their place in Bloc Party but Intimacy demonstrated their limits).
Those underwhelmed by Octopus should still make the effort to check out the album in its entirety. The debut single is likely the weakest track; not bad by any means but certainly meagre in context. Instead of computerised beats, the record takes the two thirds form of honest, straightforward hard-rock, hugely reminiscent of bassist Moake’s Young Legionnaire. 3×3, Kettling, and We’re Not Good People find the quartet channeling their inner Queens of the Stone Age to fantastic effect. The remaining third, in particular Day Four and The Healing demonstrate their retained ability to create the touching, sombre, indie ballads which Bloc Party have been known and renowned for in the past. It’s a combination which works well and never falters throughout the album’s 43 minute running time.
I usually like minimalism but in the case of Four‘s cover art, I can’t help but be a little disappointed. It is a jarring choice considering the band’s history of provocative artwork. What should probably be a striking example of ‘less is more’ appeal ultimately undermines the record’s visual impact, a result of unfulfilled expectation.
I’ve looked hard but that’s about the only flaw I can really find with Four. Maybe it’s my Bloc Party fanboyism or a hunger gone unsatisfied for so long clouding my judgement, but I can’t really care when I’m still enjoying it so much after so many listens.
It was worth the wait.","What is the general impression of Bloc Party's album ""Four"" according to the context?","The album ""Four"" by Bloc Party is generally well-received. It is seen as a collection of songs that are lucky to exist considering the band’s recent history. The album feels like a team effort and doesn't contain any of the electronica that the lead singer indulged in over the past few years. It is a combination of hard-rock and touching, sombre, indie ballads which works well and never falters throughout the album’s 43 minute running time. The only flaw mentioned is the minimalistic cover art which undermines the record’s visual impact."
"With each passing day, although neither team has played a game and – because it’s an evaluation period and neither staff can speak to a recruit – Rutgers puts more distance between itself and in-state rival Seton Hall.
By the end of the week, Fred Hill, Jr., will formally become the next coach of the Scarlet Knights, replacing Gary Waters, who resigned.
The Post learned that St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley is considering an opportunity to join Hill’s staff, but the timing probably isn’t right.
“Who wouldn’t want a legendary coach like Bob Hurley on his bench?” Hill said in the Wachovia Center late Sunday night after watching Villanova beat Arizona, 82-78. “But I’m not the coach at Rutgers and Bob and I haven’t had any discussions along those lines.”
Hurley has 873 wins at St. Anthony and would like to post 900 as a high school coach. He is the most respected prep coach in the Garden State and, should he ever decide to become a college assistant, would be a major coup for any Big East program.
“At this point I’m looking forward to two more years at St. Anthony,” Hurley said. “I feel I need a number to get me to shut it down and the 900 is out there. Then I think I’d like to try something else in coaching.”
Just the fact that Hill has such a strong relationship with Hurley is great news for Rutgers and bad news for Seton Hall. Seton Hall coach Louis Orr has two years left on his contract, but his status is in limbo.
Orr wants an extension, but sources said the administration at the South Orange school is not convinced Orr has established solid enough state recruiting ties. The Pirates will lose their two best players next season – guard Donald Copeland and center Kelly Whitney – and they have no recruits signed.
According to the sources, Orr is mulling three possible scenarios: He accepts a guaranteed one-year extension; he opts to leave because an extension isn’t offered; he refuses to make changes to his staff, forcing a parting of the ways.
Seton Hall athletic director Joe Quinlan did not return phone calls, but Quinlan – who will meet with Orr this week – has a list of candidates in case he needs to make a change.
Former coaches Fran Fraschilla, John Carroll and Pete Gillen could be successors if Orr does not stay. Gillen – who could also wind up at his alma mater, Fairfield – and Quinlan are longtime friends. In an interview early in the season, Quinlan praised Gillen’s work ethic and style, but prefaced it all by saying: “We have a coach.”
Carroll, one of P.J. Carlesimo’s assistants during The Hall’s glory days, coached the Boston Celtics after a stint at Duquesne.
Hofstra coach Tom Pecora, who is said to be happy in Hempstead, and George Mason coach Jim Larranaga of The Bronx are also possibilities. Both are in the midst of postseason runs – Pecora in the NIT, Larranaga in the Sweet 16.

"The rest of the game is so straighforwards and easy. I took my girlfriend, one of the people who's going to play Friday in my Aremorican Addendum playtest, and we made a character in just a couple of minutes. Hit points, armor class, weapons, everything. It took almost literally no time at all, thanks to one of the least controversial and handy house rules I ever forget that I have:
I call it the ""Ten Items or Less"" Rule. See, you can get basic items and armor for free (that's up to light armor and any one-handed item) for free, because they're practically free anyways and I'm not really picky. I don't require dynamic encumbrance counts, for one. Math at the table should be limited to figuring out one's hit rolls by subtracting THACO from the die roll, or by figuring out how much gold goes where at the end of an adventure.
But for two, you get ten items from the equipment table for free. You can have a bedroll, two torches, waterskin (water), flask(rum), two 50' ropes, tent, blanket, and 10' pole. Or you could have a hammer, 50' rope, waterskin (water), two blankets, three days of rations, a bedroll, and a tent. For free. Seriously, don't even count them, it doesn't matter. I'm not looking over your math anyways, just take ten items, stick them in a backpack, and spend your gold on weapons, armor, ammunition, that sort of thing. When you're done, though, all your gold is gone. Instead of keeping it, you get 1d6x10 silver. That's 10-60, roughly a month's wages for a skilled laborer.
See, this rule does a couple of things. Firstly, it means that players aren't agonizing over whether to spend their 5 silver on ropes at character creation. There are more interesting times to worry about gold, and that's at the table, not when we're trying to figure out who's bringing what and how. Second, it's essentially a starting package for you- you have some odds and ends, and it encourages creativity. So you've already got food, water, shelter, and light. You've got another item to bring. Should you bring parchment? What about a quill? Will we need pitons? That sort of thing.
And lastly, it means that characters start out kind of poor. You know, the driving motivation behind half of what Conan does (the other half being revenge), and all of what people do in Theives' World. It's the simplest, and easiest motivation in the world. If a night in an inn costs 1 gold, and you currently have roughly 1/6th of one gold peice, you're going to need to make back the investment you guys just now made into all of that shiny armor and weapons and stuff. Hey, night's falling. You'd better get moving, the town guard doesn't take kindly to vagrants.
All of these things are good things. You still have to spend money outside of character creation, of course, so that the rope and pitons and stuff you brought will be more expensive next time. With any luck, of course, you'll be coming back to town with 500-600 gold, so maybe it'll be time to upgrade that plate armor for once, and then spend time in town recuperating and training and all that. Without any luck, you'll come back into town broke and half dead, with the blood of henchmen on your boots, but that's neither here nor there. Come back with your shield or on it, as they say!","What is the ""Ten Items or Less"" Rule in the game context described?","The ""Ten Items or Less"" Rule in the game context described allows players to get basic items and armor for free, up to light armor and any one-handed item. Additionally, players can choose ten items from the equipment table for free. These items can be anything from a bedroll, torches, waterskin, flask, ropes, tent, blanket, pole, hammer, rations, etc. The rule is designed to simplify the game and encourage creativity among players. After selecting these items, all the player's gold is gone and they receive 1d6x10 silver instead."
"Up and down the hills
Up and down the hills in the desertRight outside our door is a small dirt road. To call it a road is a stretch I think, more like a 4 wheeler path. It goes up and down hills, around and through washes, and keeps going farther then we have been on it. Mom has been taking Torrey on this road and they are running and hiking up and down the hills. Torrey is wiped out when they get back, so it must be fun.
Torrey is so fast , good but dont go to far from mom :)

That looks like a place we would love to run around with and take Mom along too. We would be worn out, but Mom says it is not fair because she would probably be worn out too but couldn’t just lie down and sleep like us because there is always work to do. Poor moms, they have it rough! Happy Monday!

Emma, that is so true. Mom would like to crash out too, but nothing doing. That would be so fun if you came and ran with them.
Looks like a great place to get fit! Wish I was walking those hills with you! I am dying for some good exercise at this point :-)
Have a Merry Christmas!

Roxy I lay like that sometimes its very cozy! Torrey, I get very mischievious in the park when Mom lets me off leash. I take one last look at her to let her know I am taking off and then I’m gone. Not too far before I stop to make sure she’s following me of course. That’s the whole game. Merry Christmas! Love Dolly

"Guys flirt in many different ways, some guys are touchy feely, some just constantly make jokes, so like to talk about how tough they are. I'm a little too shy for those approaches, so I've figured out the perfect strategy for instantly winning a girl over. It's a process, so it takes time, but it's so far been effective. I'm even in this process with two girls at work.
As we've learned, I'm not the type who can walk up and get a number on the spot, some guys have the charm, or body, to overcome the creepiness of that strategy, I don't. Just like all strategies it's important to pick one that fits your strengths and weakness. My strengths almost all reside on or in my head. I don't have the hottest body, genes have decided I should remain a bit skinny, so I don't have those huge muscles the ladies love. I do have cool blue eyes, boyish good-looks, and,what many women over the years have said is my most irresistible trait, dimples.
I'm a shy person, I'm not a smooth-talker from the get-go, I like to learn things before initiating a conversation, or allow the conversation to come to me. At work, finding opportunities to talk or learn anything about an attractive girl is a bit tough.
Like I said, this is a process. I like to start out by smiling as soon as we make eye contact. For some reason girls are totally drawn in by this move. I let this continue for a few days, then I go to the ""Hey, I recognize you!"" wave along with the smile. Then finally finding an opportunity to pass in close enough proximity to get a ""Hi!"" in.
Wow, I sound like a 6th grader dealing with his first crush now that I see this in writing, surprisingly, it's totally working. The final phase is sealing the deal and opening a dialogue.
How do I plan to do this? Easy, girls love compliments, and now that she recognizes me whenever we cross paths I won't seem like I've been scouting her out. Even though I may or may not have been...
6 comments:
i can totally see how that would work. not all girls responding to the flexing braggarts.
Yeah, I'd be kind of freaked out if some random guy just came up to me and asked for my number- ""Who IS this guy?!"" Your way gets around that :)
I think this is a flippin good idea! Too bad i'm a girl and I don't know too many guys to work it on... haha oh well! I think it's a fabulous idea!
Thanks! There are some guys who just have the gift of gab, who have the guts to go up and start a conversation and walk away with a phone number, I am not one of those guys so I have to use the tools I've got!
It's really a crying shame that you're anonymous...you're exactly my type. Oh and you have freaking good taste in music.
sigh. Ah, well :P
What can I say?
Handsome
Intelligent
Creative
Charming
Funny
Caring
Did I leave anything out? But even still, I'm flattered!",What is the strategy the shy person uses to flirt with girls at work?,"The shy person's strategy involves a process of gradually increasing familiarity. It starts with smiling upon making eye contact, then progresses to a wave and a smile, and finally to saying ""Hi"" when passing by closely. The final phase is to give a compliment, now that the girl recognizes him and he doesn't seem like a stranger."
"Now that I am on winter break from school and have lots of free time on my hands, I have decided to post some book reviews that I wrote back before I started this site. I want to do this for two reasons. First of all, I love some of these books and would love to share them with you guys. Secondly, I know myself and my tendency to get obsessive during the semester and so, anticipating that there will probably be a posting drought in our future, I want to get some stuff posted here while I still can.
Today’s reviews are from Charles de Lint’s Newford series. If you are a fan of urban fantasy and you haven’t read any of the Newford books, you are seriously missing out. The series consists of novels and anthologies of short stories but I am going to focus on some of my favorite novels today and save the short stories for another time.
Someplace to be Flying
Someplace to be Flying is one of my favorite Newford books and, truth be told, one of my favorite books overall. If I had to recommend only one book to introduce a new reader to Newford, this would be the one. It really is de Lint at his best, creating a fascinating urban fantasy world where mythic, shapeshifting “First People” walk modern city streets. But it is characters that really shine here, characters like the Crow Girls and Jack Daw, that you can’t help falling in love with.
Promises to Keep / The Onion Girl / Widdershins
One of Newford’s MVPs is Jilly Coopercorn, an big-hearted artist with knack for seeing magical things in unlikely places. Some of the best Newford stories revolve around Jilly and her friends. Yet Jilly’s life has had its dark periods too. She has a history of abuse, of addiction and pain that she has never quite dealt with. These three books: Promises to Keep, The Onion Girl and Widdershins are a sort of trilogy that chronicle Jilly’s life and recovery in a way that could only be done in Newford. There are times when the books get a little rough to read – and I don’t recommend reading The Onion Girl without having Widdershins on standby – but they are incredible books in an incredible series and I strongly recommend them.",What is the name of the book series by Charles de Lint that the author of the context recommends?,The author recommends the Newford series by Charles de Lint.

"Continuing a tradition that began 60 years ago, Mercedes-Benz just unveiled their 2013 SL model. The letters “SL” have represented a blend of sport, style and comfort for six decades, but for the first time, the SL is being constructed almost entirely of aluminum, consequently tipping the scales at considerably less than its predecessor. The 2013 SL550 will become available this spring in U.S. showrooms, and compared with its successful predecessor, will serve up considerably more athletic character without sacrificing comfort, while setting new standards in the luxury roadster class.
The new SL is available with two different suspension systems, one of which is the Agility Control Suspension as standard equipment. The ABC (Active Body Control) suspension system is available as an option. Power for the SL will come from a new V8 that makes 429 horsepower; roughly 12% more despite the lower displacement, while generating 32% more torque for an increase to 516 lb.-ft. The engine features an ECO stop/start function as standard equipment, while the 7-Speed Driver-Adaptive automatic transmission has been optimized for fuel consumption and comfort. The SL550 will reach 60 mph in 4.5 seconds.
The 2013 SL combines its finely honed profile with a luxurious feel. Premium materials, perfectly finished with great attention to detail, define the style and character of the interior.. The 6th generation SL also offers a retractable hard top that can be operated using a space-saving electrohydraulic mechanism, converting the SL from coupe to roadster and back again in a matter of seconds. Two versions of the retractable hard top include either the glass or the unique panoramic roof with MAGIC SKY CONTROL.
The design of the new SL is not only aesthetically beautiful, it also boasts outstanding aerodynamic characteristics, giving the roadster top marks in its segment in three crucial areas: lowest wind noise, virtually on par with a closed sedan; the best comfort during open-air driving, meaning the roof can stay down even at high speed; and virtually no accumulation of dirt on the side windows. The SL is also perhaps the world’s safest roadster, thanks to the collision-optimized aluminum structure, standard equipment that includes PRE-SAFE and ATTENTION ASSIST, plus further assistance systems on par with the S-Class. Active Parking Assist is new in the SL. Using ultrasound sensors it can identify parking spaces and automatically steer the vehicle into the selected space.
Other new features include the unique Frontbass system that transforms the luxury sports car into a veritable concert hall with the top up or down and the highly efficient MAGIC VISION CONTROL. To coincide with the launch of the 2013 SL, Mercedes-Benz will also be offering a special-edition model, the Edition 1, for a limited period. It is superbly equipped and comes standard with AMG 19” alloy wheels, designo exclusive leather with contrasting topstitching, AIRSCARF, the Harman/Kardon Logic7 surround sound system and much more. The designo crystal silver magno special paintwork is available exclusively for the Edition 1. Interior upholstery is designo classic red/black exclusive with designo black piano lacquer wood trim.",What are some of the new features of the 2013 Mercedes-Benz SL model?,"The 2013 Mercedes-Benz SL model is constructed almost entirely of aluminum, making it lighter than its predecessor.

Hike Rating:
Easy
Moderate

Strenuous
Start Coordinates:
N 38 50.063, W 120 02.641
or overflow parking at N 38 50.022, W 120 02.552
End Coordinates:
Same as Start Coordinates
Car Shuttle Req'd:
No
Parking Directions:
Take Highway 50 to just west of Echo Summit, and then turn onto Johnson Pass Road (Lincoln Highway) from the road (marked with signs to Echo Lake.) Turn left on Porcupine Road, which becomes Echo Lakes road. Follow this road to the parking coordinates.
Hazards of Note:
The first couple miles of the hike are along a very rocky section of the Pacific Crest Trail. Watch footing along this route.
Crowd Factor:
Moderate to High. This is a popular entrance into Desolation Wilderness and many of its most popular destinations. Get there early on a weekend to find parking near the trailhead.
General Notes:
Find the trailhead at the south end of Lower Echo Lake, just past the lodge on the east side of the lowest parking lot. There is a kiosk here for Desolation Wilderness permits. Cross the metal bridge going across the lake outlet and pick up the trail from this spot.
NOTE:
During the summer you can choose to take the boat shuttle to the far end of upper Echo Lake from this spot for a nominal cost, and that will save you 2 1/2 miles each direction that you use this service.
Once you pass the Upper Echo Lake on the trail or from the end of the shuttle, you will see the Desolation Wilderness signpost indicating entrance into the area, and then the destination of Tamarack Lake is not far up on your left after a continued climb up to the elevation of the three lakes in this immediate vicinity.
Since this is a hike into Desolation Wilderness, you will need a day permit (free at the trailhead) and the group size limit is 12.

"Talk:The Guardian
From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia
edit To whoever wrote this article
You should be ashamed of yourself for slandering and besmirching the name and reputation of this most glorious of newspapers. Although some of your comments may be fair- ie. the stuff about Guardian readers being the guilt-ridden bourgeoisie- some others are disgusting and caused me to vomit copiously. There is no better national English newspaper than the Guardian. This has been, is now, and will always be the case. Please save your efforts for something more deserving. ie. the Daily Mail.
- Eh, it's not thaaaat bad, but the basic thrust, ie. The Guardian is for knee-jerk leftists who aren't half as well informed as they believe they are, was done to death some time in the early 1920s, and has since stopped being funny.
- I assume by Mail you mean Mirror. Goebbels would be proud of that arse wipe newspaper.
Also it should probably be noted that a fairly large % of the writters of this article are more than likely guardian readers themselves......--The Right Honourable Maj Sir Elvis UmP KUN FIC MDA VFH Bur. CM and bars UGM F@H (Petition) 13:17, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
- I think the first post above misses the point: The Guardian is, in its own way, frequently as ridiculous as the Daily Mail. Both are politically predictable, both are read by members of the middle class who are largely cut-off from what most of the country is actually like but think they know how to run the whole world, both promote a rather simple worldview that says a small clique (""Rightwing Americans"" for the Graun, ""The Liberal Elite"" and the EU for the Mail) are responsible for everything that goes wrong in the world, and both are officially ""moderate"" in their politics (""Liberal"" and ""Conservative"" respectively) but have in-house writers (and certainly readers, judging by their websites) who are rather more extreme. I think the Guardian's the better paper because it's far more intelligent, I personally tend to agree with it more (although that's more my politics than anything else) and it's ""official"" editorial stance is rather more balanced than the Mail's. But it's still, in many ways, a paper as ripe for satirical takedown as the Mail. --Zarbag 16:00, July 20, 2010 (UTC)
edit Pinched joke
The thing about Sun readers wanting to rule the world etc is a straight steal off Yes, Prime Minister -- I don't want to remove it cos it's moderately amusing and without it the opener would be boring, but replacing it with something actually original would be good.
- Congrats your the first person to notice where it was ripped from in almost a year and a half, I think there is nowt wrong from stealing this little bit from YM/TPM given that most readers are unlikely to have seen it--The Right Honourable Maj Sir Elvis UmP KUN FIC MDA VFH Bur. CM and bars UGM F@H (Petition) 13:15, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
Well the history of The Guardian is a variant on the Wikipedia article on The Sun. When whoever wrote much of the original finds this, he will doubtless both laugh and cry ;). Seriously, as the demographics are increasingly the main thing separating newspapers rather than content or treatment we should develop this. Mark Lawson as the cultural commentator for The Sun and the Five television channel perhaps. Finger 19:11, 13 June 2007 (UTC)
edit Improvements?
This article is starting to take shape but there are still, I think, some problems:
- The ""communism"" thing - I have the same problem with this as I have with stuff about Mail readers striding around in jackboots doing stiff-armed salutes all day, namely that it's misdirected satire. The average Graun reader in the popular imagination is more of a sandle-wearing,middle-class or upper-middle-class middlebrow who, like Mail readers, gets all ""his"" opinions from his favourite paper and its columnists. He's probably a ""champagne socialist"" who's vaguely supportive of the far-left but wouldn't want to mix with them socially. He's also obsessed with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and can divert any kind of conversation towards it (this last one seems to be largely true, judging by the CiF messageboards).
- The ""History"" section needs a complete rewrite. I think a nice angle would be the fact that the Graun used to be a Manchester-based socialist newspaper and has become a very middle-class, very very London-centric ""liberal"" (in the American sense) newspaper. Perhaps show this happening slowly over time as the flat-cap ""provincial"" socialists are pushed aside by the metropolitan types.
- Some bits of it are still very weak and a bit lazy - like the ""past editors"" bit.
- It needs more stuff about the Graun's various sections. I've already done a wee section on the various cartoons found in the paper.
--Zarbag 14:27, May 21, 2011 (UTC)
- Will consider a rewrite on the History Section as it doesn't fit with the rest of the article. --
RomArtus*Imperator ® (Orate) 01:46, January 21, 2012 (UTC)
- Rewrite done. Still left a lot of the original paragraphs there but still needs more polish. --
RomArtus*Imperator ® (Orate) 13:19, January 21, 2012 (UTC)",What is the common criticism of The Guardian and the Daily Mail according to the discussion?,Both The Guardian and the Daily Mail are criticized for being politically predictable and read by members of the middle class who are largely cut-off from what most of the country is actually like but think they know how to run the whole world. They both promote a rather simple worldview that blames a small clique for everything that goes wrong in the world.
"So today’s challenge is “find one thing for every letter of the alphabet that you’re thankful for. Sounds straight forward enough, so let’s cut right to the chase.
A – Apple Pie — c’mon…warm apple pie with a scoop of ice cream? There’s no finer dessert on earth.
B – Baseball – There were so many choices for B (Beer, Blues Music, Bourbon) but ultimately, the rhythms, the ebb and flow of a game and sharing that with family and friends….yup…it had to be baseball.
C – Children – mine, yours all of them. Take the time to discover the world through children’s eyes. You’ll be thankful too.
D – My Dynamo — it’s just amazing to watch her grow and develop everyday.
E – Eggs — so simple and yet so versatile.
F – Family – near or far. I treasure every member of my family, even if I don’t tell them that often enough.

P – Poppi – It’s the family name my kids use for my dad, their grandfather. Read “G” again, if you still need to know why.
Q – Quiet Time – that sweet spot in the day when both kids and the dog are all napping. Love that.
R – Red Wine — HEY! My doctor says it’s good for my cholesterol. That’s my story and I’m sticking with it.

Y – Youth Sports – as my son has gotten into organized athletics, I’m surprised at just how rewarding I have found the coaching experience. Those kids give me far more than I could ever teach them. It’s a great adventure.
Z – The Zillions and Zillions of smiles and laughs that I’ve had the great fortune of sharing with family, friends and co-workers. From the simple silly giggles to the eye-watering, hyperventalating, stop-it-I-can’t-breathe belly busters, I cherish every moment we’ve shared and I look forward to Zillions and Zillions more.

"2017 Information Management Symposium – Summary
This turning insight into action, as summed up by Jeff Cribbs of Gartner describes the road ahead for data analysis in the health insurance industry. Trends in this year’s discussions were artificial intelligence, curated data visualization and aligning business with technology and government partnerships to source the right data.
Following are highlights from several of the discussions:
Data Visualization Keynote – Audrey Halvorson and Raji Dasari told a story about how adopting Tableau reduced IT costs for generating reports and data visualizations and provided the customer and provider with a 360-degree experience.
Customer Experience Backbone Keynote – Cindy Montgomery and Garrett Anderson put forward a new system architecture that incorporates artificial intelligence into the data analysis process. They demonstrated how a banner in their online member portal would be displayed based on the persona that the AI would associate to the member. The banner would provide a link to further information tailored to the member. He foresees integrating the Customer Experience Backbone and AI with chatbots and other interactive tools.
Member Information: The Big Picture – Brent Leland from BCBSKC talked about the importance of a good member patient index algorithm to reduce operating costs by automatically matching data records and alleviate manual data processing. Marco Weixler from ICW, who partnered with BCBSKC on the project, developed an engine based on a statistical model to automate the matching process.
Medication Reconciliation Provider Data Enablement – Allison Combs and Louis Polite presented the business and technical perspectives of BCBSM’s achievements to integrate with the MiHIN member data feed. MiHIN is a state-wide network for routing health records between interested parties. They have a publish & subscribe model and a security model for dealing with sensitive information. By integrating with the MiHIN network, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan will improve its data to offer competitive pharmacy services benefits, wellness and care management intervention benefits, and medical reconciliation programs. We look forward to hearing an update next year on the evolution of the system.
Leveraging Key Indicators to Drive Benefit Decisions – Timothy Donald presented the BCBSNJ configuration of Tableau to help with the sales process and drive the decision process.
Gartner Keynote – Jeff Cribbs presented a vision of the future of the healthcare insurance industry. A thought-provoking presentation, Jeff proposed the Health Value Management Organization (HVMO) – a transformation in the industry towards proving improved health value to the customer. The areas targeted for innovation were artificial intelligence in health IT, a member engagement hub, economics of connection and the Internet of Things like home health monitoring.
The Jonah Group team shared with attendees some of our recent work with Michigan Health Insurance providers.
- Built for a leading IPA in Michigan, HealthFocus is a web application that allows practitioners to manage patient care, their measures, and provider compliance rates & goals. The application is fully integrated with the host’s existing data warehouse.
- Also built for the data warehouse is a pair of critical processing engines. The first provides a master patient reference with heuristics for cleansing, merging, and matching duplicate and near-duplicate patient data from disparate and volatile external data feeds. The second is a HEDIS measure and conditions engine for calculation of compliance rates across a range of over one hundred different measures and across hundreds of practice offices.
With data analytics and big data being a common theme, Jonah Group’s work with AMD was of interest. We designed, built and implemented a big data system on Hadoop.
The symposium board members did a great job lining up interesting talks, facilitating good networking opportunities and providing fun entertainment. The event was a great success!

"Armagh ready for fresh promotion push
January 26, 2015
Richard Bullick
Armagh will look to inspirational All Star corner back Mairead Tennyson to effectively curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in Sunday’s National League opener at Cloghan (2pm).
McLaughlin is the talk of the country after firing Termon to the All-Ireland Senior Club Championship before Christmas and Armagh got a glimpse of her prowess in last June’s Ulster semi-final.
But switching Tennyson to mark her that day in Lisnaskea proved an inspired decision by manager James Daly and the Silverbridge livewire looks likely to take direct responsibility again this weekend.
Tennyson and veteran vice-captain Caoimhe Morgan are a very experienced pair of Orchard defenders and the latter’s sister Sarah Marley will be back alongside them in the Armagh rearguard after missing last summer’s entire Championship campaign with a broken ankle.
The tenacious corner back’s return will presumably enable St Paul’s schoolgirl Louise Kenny to slot into the vacancy left by stalwart wing back Sharon Reel stepping back due to business pressures though the likes of Rebecca O’Reilly, Roisin Murphy, Danielle Morgan and Shauna Grey will also have their eye on a starting spot.
O’Reilly got a taste of the big-time last summer when deputising for injured Carrickcruppen clubmate Marian McGuinness in the All-Ireland quarter and semi-finals and will hopefully push hard for further opportunities now her experienced colleague has returned.
A third Marley sibling, Niamh, wasn’t fit to start that last Donegal game, in which Armagh found themselves trailing by four points early on, but played a prominent part in turning the tide following her introduction.
Armagh went on to win by six that day but Donegal have home advantage this time and have been buoyed by that Termon triumph so will want to avenge last summer’s result and start strongly as they bid to bounce back from relegation.
For their part, Armagh are determined to hit the ground running in their bid for a second successive promotion in the NFL and, although this should be a significant step-up from Division Three which they romped through with a 100 percent record 12 months ago, the Orchard outfit beat four top flight teams last summer in the Championship.
These sides spent last spring playing two League levels apart but appear well matched and are both tipped to make the play-offs along with Westmeath, with Meath and Down also hopeful of a top-four finish.
On paper this arguably looks like Armagh’s toughest game of the entire campaign and something of a baptism of fire in an otherwise favourable fixture list which has handed them five home matches out of the remaining six.
In a division dominated by Ulster sides, Daly’s ladies won’t have to leave their own province for a regular League game and, with the only other trip being to Cavan, this weekend’s road trip to beyond Ballybofey is the longest journey they will undertake.
With the table’s top two being given home semi-finals for the first time, every match counts for more than in previous seasons and although this first result will hardly define anyone’s season, both teams are expected to put their best foot forward for what should be an intriguing tussle.
Especially if former captain Mags McAlinden has hung up her inter-county boots, Daly might hand a first start to young Shane O’Neill’s shooting star Aimee Mackin in the full forward line or utilise the teenager as an impact player off the bench.
Last season’s supersub Siobhan Mackle is off to the United States on a university placement so the Armagh manager could earmark Mackin as the new ace up his sleeve to bring on in the hope of changing a tight game.
Already an established senior international in women’s soccer, prolific forward Mackin has developed physically since her brief involvement last spring and, with her 18th birthday looming in April, appears ready to contribute to the Orchard cause.
Team-mates Sinead McCleary and Niamh Henderson had both worn the orange jersey in Croke Park finals before turning 18 and ace markswoman Mackin should prove a very valuable addition to the Armagh ranks this season.
Other fresh faces in the panel include her Shane O’Neill’s club colleague Moya Feehan, Forkhill sisters Lauren and Megan Sheridan and Lissummon’s Sarah Gamble, a diminutive centre half forward who really caught the eye at club level last season.
Every manager wants increasing competition for places and developing depth is one of Armagh’s aims as they seek to build on the impressive progress of 2014 and deliver on their trio of challenging goals for this season.
Securing back to back promotions, retaining their provincial crown and reaching Croke Park in September are testing targets but Armagh have been back in training since November and are ambitious to show that last season’s surprise package are no flash in the pan.
Having initially taken time to consider their futures, the highly-regarded Daly and his impressive management team are back fully focused on taking this team to another level and the players have been working with Ireland’s top trainer Mike McGurn ahead of the new campaign.
In iconic captain Caroline O’Hanlon, Armagh have the All-Ireland Player of the Year in their ranks while the versatile McCleary and forceful centre half forward Fionnuala McKenna can go one better than their richly-deserved All Star nominations of last term.
Last season’s newcomers, Crossmaglen’s Lauren McConville and Aoife McCoy of Dromintee, got 27 starts between them in Armagh’s 14 matches in 2014 which shows how it is possible for fresh talent to force its way into what looks like a settled side.
Few will emulate her All Star status but Tennyson’s superb example last season in finding a new personal level can also inspire players to hit fresh heights and help push Armagh to greater glory.
Armagh are no longer under the wider radar and last season’s success brought the All Ireland dream back to life, but for now Daly and his players are rightly fully focused on an NFL promotion push and this Donegal game will be a tough first test of their credentials.",Who is expected to curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in the National League opener?,All Star corner back Mairead Tennyson is expected to curb the threat of Donegal dangerwoman Geraldine McLaughlin in the National League opener.
"Aero Press Release Story
Bauchau Named First Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft
The University of Maryland welcomes Dr. Olivier Bauchau as the first Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 30, 2015
Jennifer Rooks
301 405 1458
jfrooks@umd.edu
College Park, Md. – The University of Maryland welcomes Dr. Olivier Bauchau as the first Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft. Bauchau brings thirty-plus years of experience in the rotorcraft field to the university. He is a widely recognized scholar in aeromechanics of rotorcraft, multibody and structural dynamics, composite structures, and wind turbine systems.
Supported through an endowment from Sikorsky and United Technologies, the Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professorship in Rotorcraft is part of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and serves to support enhanced research specialization in areas related to rotorcraft. Sikorsky Aircraft is a world leader in helicopter design, manufacture and service headquartered in Connecticut, and is a subsidiary of United Technologies.
Dr. Bauchau’s work on comprehensive aeromechanics analysis of rotorcraft, modeling of flexible multibody systems involving composite structures, and modeling of rotor lag dampers are pioneering efforts in the rotary-wing field. At Maryland he aims to harness research being done in computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and rotorcraft to contribute to his computational modeling work in both rotorcraft and the wind energy industry.
In addition to an extensive research background, Bauchau brings strong industry and government relationships. He is the architect behind the comprehensive multibody dynamics code, DYMORE, which is widely adopted by companies like Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter, government laboratories such as NASA Ames Research Center and academic institutions. The code is used to model all aspects of helicopter design such as dynamics, aerodynamics, controls, and composite materials.
""It's very exciting to be here,"" Bauchau said. ""Maryland has always had a strong program in rotorcraft, and this professorship sends a very clear signal that Maryland continues to grow and strengthen that area of research.""
Bauchau completed his Ph.D. (1981) in Aeronautics & Astronautics at MIT in the area of Structural Dynamics. In 1983, he joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, and Mechanics, and later became Associate Professor with Tenure. In 1995, Bauchau moved to Georgia Tech as a Professor in Aerospace Engineering until 2010, when he joined the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (Shanghai, China) as a Professor. He joined Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2014 as Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
Bauchau is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and he has authored two textbooks and published 88 archival journal papers and 175 conference proceedings papers. In 2012, he received the Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association. Recognized as an outstanding teacher, Georgia Tech twice awarded him their “Thanks for Being a Great Teacher” Award, and during his academic career, he has advised 22 students who completed their Ph.D. dissertations.
Most recently, ASME recognized his numerous contributions to the field by awarding him the 2016 ASME d’Alembert Award. The award, established in 2005, recognizes his lifelong contributions to the field of multibody system dynamics.
The Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professorship in Rotorcraft is one of many efforts in the long-term relationship between United Technologies, Sikorsky and the Clark School of Engineering to expand Maryland's rotorcraft curriculum, research programs and intellectual capital while being a continuous source for the world's best rotorcraft engineers..",Who was named as the first Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft at the University of Maryland?,Dr. Olivier Bauchau was named as the first Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft at the University of Maryland.

Through one-of-a-kind online course materials and collaborative “electronic campfires” (video webinars), we will explore through personal stories and experiences, videos, published articles and books by Dr. Blumenkrantz and others with great wisdom to share. And, as a special bonus participants will receive and be guided in readings from David’s next book, published by Oxford University Press: Coming of Age the RITE Way: Youth & Community Development through Rites of Passage.
Together we will build a “Learning Community to explore:
-
What to Expect
- Emergent design experience for learning how to co-author a rite of passage “story” in your community
- Online materials such as one of a kind videos, published articles and excerpts from books by Dr. Blumenkrantz and others with great wisdom to share (all electronic campfire materials will be included with membership although supplemental materials may be suggested for desired for your work beyond our collaborations)
- 4 collaborative “Electronic Campfires” (video webinars) to share our reflections, revelations, growth and change of consciousness
Discovering Our Shared Story
Youth & community development through rites of passage is a whole system’s approach to help us move from “what’s my story” and “what’s your story” to “what’s our story” that is shared between youth and their community (and then their community with other communities).
If the children are indeed our future than the stories about how we educate and help them come of age are the most important stories to get right. Since 1966 Dr. David Blumenkrantz from the Center of Youth & Community has been exploring concepts, theories, stories and practices related to youth and community development. He has worked in a wide array of places co-designing and helping identify core principles related to a new story he has called youth and community development through rites of passage.
When we get the story RITE, we get our future right.
Join David, Jen, and others from around the world for this online emergent design experience that will help you become a catalyst for change and support initiating youth and community development through rites of passage. By learning to rush to reflection before action we can change the story and transform the future.

"The Beverley Hills apartment buildings are curious, full of character, and to be honest, a little out of place. Situated on the banks of the Yarra River, with Melbourne’s gleaming city skyline beyond, these buildings channel a kind of faded Hollywood glamour, and are often the subject of intrigue for passers by, inspiring a certain level of curiosity about those who might live here, and the stories from bygone years which might have unfolded within these walls.
Constructed by architect and developer Howard Lawson between 1935 and 1936, the Beverley Hills complex comprises two separate buildings, and as the name suggests, the development has a distinctly international flavour, referencing a 1930’s Hollywood / Spanish revival aesthetic, with ornate stairwells and windows, almost gothic detailing and stuccoed walls. With an impressive outdoor pool and lush gardens overflowing with palms, vines and creepers, this is about as close as Melbourne gets to LA, or perhaps even Barcelona, aesthetically speaking.
Young couple Ellie King (an illustrator, designer and proprietor of online shop Pieces 4 Places) and her partner Cale Sexton, a musician, have lived in this apartment for just four months. They took over the lease from close friends, who actually moved into another apartment in the same building. It’s not uncommon, when apartments become available here, for them to be quickly snapped up via word of mouth, or for tenants to move from one apartment to another. ‘Beverley Hills is definitely a place where it helps to know someone that lives here if you what to rent a place’ says Ellie. ‘It’s run by a wonderful man named Don. You gotta get past him if you want to make it in!’
Ellie is a versatile and entrepreneurial creative, she’s an illustrator and designer, and also creates her own intricate and irreverent hand embroidered artworks and homewares under the name Rittle. She also has a special gift for sourcing the most weird and wonderful vintage textiles, ceramics and art, hence the recent launch of her online store, Pieces 4 Places.
At home, Ellie’s most treasured possessions include the large Matlok Griffiths painting above her bed. It holds fond memories and makes her feel somewhat ‘grown up’.
‘The painting was found through my good friend Lou’s gallery, Chapter House Lane, which was right next to a cafe I used to have in the city’ explains Ellie. ‘CHL is a non for profit gallery that Lou has been running for around 4 years. I was living in an apartment in the city for the first time by myself, and wanted to feel grown up and start an art collection, so I started with the biggest piece of his that I could find. Matlok is an amazing Melbourne-based artist so I’m very proud to have one of his pieces above my bed!’
Having been here for just four months, the novelty of living in this iconic building has yet to wear off for Ellie and Cale. ‘It feels like you are on holiday in another country!’ says Ellie. Aside from the unique character of the building itself (not to mention that incredible pool!), the community here is very much at the heart of what makes these apartments special. ‘We have excellent neighbours that lend you blenders when you want a smoothie but are too cheap to go out and buy one’ Ellie confirms. It’s unanimous then!
Huge thanks to Ellie and Cale (and Don!) for letting us photograph and share their very special home.

I love when you show homes that are ‘real’. You can see they are loved, lived in and contain pieces that mean something to the owners, not just purchased because the rest of the world has. Brilliant.
OMG Lucy it’s like Melrose Place! Sweet apartment too x
There is nothing I don’t love about this house. SO GOOD!
Absolutely LOVE this home. Great stuff! Super cute. Xx

Soooo lovely to see this post on this cold London morning. We had an apartment here 14 years ago and I’ve never forgotten the building – it had such a magic to it, from the plants hanging down inside the internal staircase and the huge bougainvillea on the outside – so many happy memories.

"What is Testing?
In the software development life cycle, we find that testing is an important and integral part. Most people are of the view that testing phase can only be initiated for testing once the code is ready. They are wrong!!!
Testing will in fact be initiated from the requirements gathering phase until the stage when the product goes live. i.e. into production.
Let’s see the set of documents that aid testing during the various phases of software development.
With the onus on testing to deliver quality products, it became necessary to have a set of documents that are manageable and make sense to the development community. In comes various tools that will aid the testing and development community to track these documents. These tools manage all the testing activities and provide different kinds of reports.
The most prominent one of these tools is the Quality Center.
Visible advantages of using Quality Center
1) Analyzes the progress of the testing activity.
- It is illustrated in terms of percentages for the Pass/ Fail scenarios.
2) Aids management to analyze and take future steps accordingly.
What is Quality Center?
It is a web based application that enables and provides visibility and traceability to the entire testing process from the requirements to the test result analysis.
Features of Quality Center
1) Primary a Test Management Tool.
2) It provides/ offers an organized framework for testing applications.
3) Helps in organizing various test documents and managing all phases of application testing process (This step also includes testing requirement specifications, Test Plans). The activities that are supported are creating test requirements, planning for tests, execution of tests, and tracking related defects.
The main advantage is the ability to integrate all the tasks involved in testing (for application), hence we derive the maximum benefit of the best quality products.
4) Ability to access your testing assets anytime, anywhere via a browser interface. (Accessibility is provided by means of username, password).
5) Ability to create an end-to-end quality management infrastructure
The Quality Management infrastructure necessarily means
- Requirements
- TEst Cases
- Test Results
- Test Analysis Reports
6) Manage manual and automated tests.
- Manual tests can be accessed by opening the script and testing the same. Results are provided manually.
- Automated test scripts can be referenced and the outcome can be indicated based on the outcome of the script result.
7) Analyze application readiness at any point in the testing process with integrated graphs and reports.
Requirements in Quality Center?
What are requirements?
According to the definition, the requirements includes all those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries or users. In short, this is what the client ultimately wants.
Requirements can be stated in any of the following forms
- SRS – System Requirement Specifications
- URS – Users Requirement Specifications.
Requirements can be added by selecting Requirements from the left panel.
Test Plans
It is a facility through which the user will be able to add test cases, arrange and categorize those test cases, based on need.
What is required for inserting/ creating test cases into Quality Center?
1) In orderr to add the relevant test cases into QC, we need to create testcases in the format typical for QC update (compatible to QC).
2) The test case is identified by three (3) parameters
- Subject (The details indicated under the SUBJECT will enable QC to segregate based on the first level hierarchy. E.g. It may well be your client name say “Client1”). Client1\Regression\Phase2
- TestName (Will consider the last level in the hierarchy to classify and store the related test cases. E.g. It may be a test scenario called “Offline”). Client1\Regression\Phase2\User Access
- Description (Will be an inherent part of the test case and will be visible when the user opens the test case through the test lab.
Example of a description column entry
- Objective : Verifying the Login feature to the application.
- Username : admin
- Password : n13da
- Precondition : The user should have invoked the application on any of the browsers IE7, IE8, FireFox, Google Chrome.
- Remarks (if any) :
How are test cases written?
a) Test cases are written in Excel in the format indicated below.
- Subject
- TestName
- Description
- StepName
- Step Description
- Expected Result
- Designer
- TestCase Status
- Priority
b) The “TestCase Status” column will have the entry “Design” which is later change to “Ready to Execute”.
c) Test cases are always written in Excel and later uploaded into QC.
d) As seen in the figure earlier, the Subject and TestName will identify the level of the test case.
e) Ensure that the StepName is written sequentially as “Step 0”, “Step 1”, …
f) The Description contains
- Objective
- User details
- PreCondition

Very useful blog! Keep it up.
Thanks
Software Testing
Please let me know some unique features of QC apart from the basic flow.
Hi Andy,
QC is an application that will enable the testers and the management to
1) Track the execution of the test cases which are arranged and ordered in test suites.
2) Enable the management to arrive at specific information from the metrics provided within QC.
3) Enable the testers to effectively test and trace each and every test case within QC.
4) Makes the testers job easier since it enables tracing from requirements to test suites/ test cases to defects. Defect ID in the form of URL from a defect tracking application can be copied and saved for each test case so that traceability exist when the user wants to know the reason for failure.
This blog is very useful. I want to know how to get a report of test cases wrote by a feature/folder and by a QA tester from QC 11 Test plan.
Thanks

Clipper Race fleet sets sail to Wondrous Whitsundays
The Clipper 2017-18 Round the World Yacht Race fleet has embarked on the last race of its All-Australian Leg, as it races up the east coast of Australia to the Whitsundays in Race 4: The Wondrous Whitsundays Race.
The All-Australian Leg is the fourth of eight legs, which make up the 40,000 nautical mile voyage around the world, and is certainly full of challenge and adrenaline with the Clipper Race crews having completed a gruelling race around the south of Australia from Fremantle to Sydney, followed by the iconic Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race.
Now, they’ve dusted off their kit and hoisted sails again, as they depart for the ‘Wondrous Whitsundays Race’, which takes them from Hobart to the Whitsundays, on Friday, January 5, 2018.
Expected to take between eight and 10 days, the ‘Wondrous Whitsundays Race’ – so-called to reflect the wonder and beauty of the Whitsundays – will see the Clipper Race yachts arrive into Airlie Beach between January 13 and 15, 2018.
Once in the Whitsundays, the Clipper Race crew, who represent over 20 different nationalities, will take a very welcome two-week break, enjoying everything the tropical island paradise has to offer with their families and friends.
The region is ready to roll out the red carpet for its guests, with an action-packed, two-week Whitsundays Clipper Race Carnival planned from January 13 to 29, 2018.
Tourism Industry Development Minister Kate Jones said the Clipper Race Carnival, supported by the Queensland Government through Tourism and Events Queensland, would provide a boost to tourism and the local economy.
“Visitors to the Whitsundays during the two week carnival are expected to spend millions, with multiple events to experience in this spectacular region.
“The Clipper Round the World Yacht Race is both an adventure, and a gruelling test of strength and skill, and competitors will welcome the break in the idyllic Whitsundays.
“The Carnival is a collection of events that will showcase the Whitsundays stunning scenery and reaffirm the region’s reputation as one of the world’s premier sailing destinations.”
Tourism Whitsundays CEO Craig Turner said it was an honour to host the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race fleet, and to be able to name a race after the Whitsundays was truly exciting.
“When we started planning the Whitsundays Clipper Race Carnival we engaged a branding consultant so our promotions would all have the same consistent look and feel going forward, with the brand colours of blue and mauve reflecting the colours of the Whitsundays along with the excitement of the carnival,” he said.
“The word wondrous was chosen to describe the Whitsundays in event promotions, as it sums up what our beautiful, wonderful region is all about – wondrous experiences on land and sea, wondrous views and 74 island wonders. So for the consortia, it was a natural extension to name the race the ‘Wondrous Whitsundays Race’.
“We are very excited that the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race organisers have allowed us to name the last race of the Australian leg in honour of the Whitsundays, and our wondrous region will go down in Clipper Race history!”
Clipper Race Founder and Chairman Sir Robin Knox-Johnston said: “I am very much looking forward to the Clipper 2017-18 Race arriving in the Whitsundays later this month.
“In addition to excellent sailing conditions and a stunning location for crew to enjoy, the inaugural Whitsundays Clipper Race Carnival will make for a fantastic two week celebration of sailing and it is great to have the Clipper Race at the heart of it.” Whitsundays Clipper Race Carnival including the Bendigo Bank Clipper Welcome Party, the Fish D’Vine White on Whitehaven Long Lunch and the Whitsunday Foodservice Progressive Cruise Lunch.

"The global swine industry adopted early-weaning practices a generation ago. However, early weaned piglets have been characterized by poor growth performance, known as the “postweaning lag.” A transient hypersensitivity response to new exposure to soy protein is one reason for the lag in post-weaning growth performance. Soybean meal (SBM) is commonly used as the primary protein source in pig diets. While some of the proteins in SBM are more easily digested, others can be quite difficult, especially for newly weaned piglets. The proteins that cause piglets the most problems include glycinin, which makes up about 40% of the total soybean protein, and β-conglycinin, which makes up about 30% of the total protein.
These soy proteins have been found to be allergenic within the intestinal lumen. Studies indicate that if an allergic reaction is mounted at the intestinal level, a local inflammation is generated, affecting protein and lipid metabolism and damaging the intestinal lining cells as shown by villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia which reduces nutrient absorption capacity. Some have also suggested that the proliferation of E. coli observed in the nursery phase may be more opportunistic due to these changes, rather than a primary cause. Moreover, unlike antinutritional factors present in SBM, thermal treatment in soybean does not alleviate glycinin and β-conglycinin which exposes nursery piglets to risk. Considering that about 70% of the total soybean proteins are difficult for piglet digestion, it helps explain why a high inclusion of SBM in newly weaned piglet diets can lead to gut health issues often resulting in diarrhea and reduced growth performance. Therefore, SBM inclusion to newly weaned piglet diets is often limited, combining with other animal protein sources which do not contain anti-nutritional factors, such as fish meal, plasma proteins, and milk proteins. However, the digestibility benefits of such animal protein sources come at a cost, as they are more expensive than soybean meal.
Protease Offers Solution:
CIBENZA® DP100 enzyme feed additive is a broad range protease which hydrolyzes different protein substrates including glycinin and β-conglycinin which can reduce the piglet’s allergic response and help post-weaning growth performance. A study conducted by Novus International investigated the in vitro ability of protease to hydrolyze soybean glycinin and β- conglycinin and then evaluated the in vivo effects of protease on performance, intestinal morphology, and inflammatory response of nursery piglets fed corn-soybean diets with different crude protein concentrations. A saturated protease solution (1 ml) was added to two blank controls of either glycinin or β-conglycinin.
The in vitro study clearly demonstrated the ability of protease to hydrolyze glycinin and β- conglycinin (figure 1). While only 12% of the glycinin and 24% of the β-conglycinin were hydrolyzed in the control, 95% of the glycinin and 89% of the β-conglycinin were hydrolyzed in the incubations with added protease.
Following the in vitro study, an in vivo study was conducted to evaluate the effect of the protease in hydrolyzing glycinin and β-conglycinin and consequently reducing intestinal allergic reaction to soybean proteins. A total of 280 nursery piglets were fed two levels of soybean meal (15% and 30%) and protease was added to the diet with higher inclusion of soybean meal. After 21 days on diets, blood was collected from piglets to assess lymphocyte proliferation, which is used as an indicator of allergic reaction response. Piglets supplemented with protease, although fed high SBM diets, had reduced lymphocyte proliferation to piglets fed low SBM diets (figure 2). Results indicated that the allergic reaction to glycinin and β-conglycinin was lower in piglets fed diets supplemented with protease. These results confirm that the hydrolysis of glycinin and β-conglycinin observed in vitro was mimicked in vivo, reducing hypersensitivity to soybean protein.
Another in vivo experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of protease on intestinal inflammation, gut morphology and growth performance. A total of 190 nursery piglets were fed diets with or without protease. At the end of the three-week trial, blood was collected from piglets for assessment of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α; indicators of gut inflammation) and ileum samples were collected for morphometry assessment. Protease supplementation reduced (P < 0.01) the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 (Figure 3; same pattern observed for other pro-inflammatory cytokines), increased (P < 0.01) villus height and reduced (P = 0.08) crypt depth from ileum (Figure 4), which altogether indicates diminished intestinal inflammation for nursery piglets fed diets containing protease. As a result, daily gain and feed conversion ratio were significantly improved (P < 0.01; Figure 5, 6) by protease supplementation compared with those fed non-supplemented diets.",What is the effect of protease supplementation on the growth performance and gut health of nursery piglets fed with soybean meal?,"Protease supplementation in the diet of nursery piglets fed with soybean meal reduces the piglet’s allergic response to difficult-to-digest soy proteins, glycinin and β-conglycinin, and helps improve post-weaning growth performance. It was found to reduce intestinal allergic reactions to soybean proteins, diminish intestinal inflammation, and improve daily gain and feed conversion ratio."

“In Cleveland County, we know how important the economic development process is to North Carolina. Having a good job solves so many problems for families, and our employers can hire from a world-class workforce in our state.”
“I’m proud to accept this award today because it highlights the positive economic impact and success of recent reforms we’ve passed in the North Carolina House of Representatives.”
The N.C. Economic Development Association listed the following economic success in North Carolina

"Researchers have found that women with endometriosis, especially those age 40 or younger, may have a higher risk of heart disease. The research paper, titled “Endometriosis and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease,” was published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, an American Heart Association journal.
The team reviewed medical data of 116,430 women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study II, taking into account alternative therapies for the treatment of the disease, including oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy. By the end of follow-up, endometriosis was diagnosed by surgical examination in 11,903 of all examined women.
During the 20-year follow-up, scientists found that women with endometriosis were 1.35 times more likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery or coronary angioplasty procedure/stent, a higher risk (1.52) of myocardial infarction and 1.91 times more likely to develop chest pain (angina). Relative risk of coronary heart disease was highest among women ages 40 years or younger. Compared to patients without endometriosis in the same age group, those suffering from the condition were three times more likely to have a heart attack, chest pain, or need treatment for blocked arteries.
Researchers also noted that surgical treatment for endometriosis could be involved in this higher risk for heart disease: Removing the uterus or ovaries (surgically-induced menopause) may increase the risk for heart disease, which may be more evident at younger ages. Moreover, the higher frequency of these specific surgeries and the earlier the age at surgery after endometriosis diagnosis can partially explain the association between endometriosis and coronary heart disease.
“It is important for women with endometriosis — even young women — to adopt heart-healthy lifestyle habits, be screened by their doctors for heart disease, and be familiar with symptoms, because heart disease remains the primary cause of death in women,” senior study author Stacey A. Missmer, Sc.D., director of epidemiologic research in reproductive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said in a news release.",What is the relationship between endometriosis and heart disease according to the research paper titled “Endometriosis and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease”?,"The research paper found that women with endometriosis, especially those age 40 or younger, may have a higher risk of heart disease. Women with endometriosis were 1.35 times more likely to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery or coronary angioplasty procedure/stent, had a higher risk (1.52) of myocardial infarction and were 1.91 times more likely to develop chest pain (angina).

"Basically, the Israel-Palestine conflict boils down poorly done planning by the Imperial British government regarding the formation of a safe-haven for the systematically oppressed Jewish minority in Europe, during the early 20th century. Zionist: A person who supports the Jewish population’s right to establish a Jewish state in the region of Palestine (known as Canaan in their holy book).In the late 1800’s, the Zionist movement began to erupt in Europe creating a revival in Jewish nationalism. Consequently, the British Secretary of Foreign Affairs declared British consent in the formation of a Jewish state in Palestine. As one would imagine, the Palestinians were not happy with this arrangement.
Eventually, In 1947, the British government transferred the situation unto the United Nation’s jurisdiction. The UN then decided implement the Partition Plan which decreased Palestinian land ownership by 78%.
The Partition Plan led to the forced migration of Palestinian natives out of their homeland, into the surrounding arab countries. This then caused a war between Israel and the surrounding arab countries, spanning from 1947-1949. Miraculously, the Israelites emerged victorious and began expanding their land further.
In 1967, Israel took control of the remaining 22% of Palestinian land: West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government began to implement laws which practically ostracized the Islamic-Palestinian community, making them second class citizens in the established Jewish state. Palestinians in Israel are not allowed to own land and are often unjustly incarcerated.
The conflict is still very much alive today. The United States government supplies the Israeli government with weaponry which they use to further oppress the palestinians and protect themselves from Islamic threats.
“Israel receives about $3 billion in direct foreign assistance each year, which is roughly one-fifth of Americas entire foreign aid budget.”
– John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt, Authors of The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy
This global dispute is one of the most complicated and controvesial in the world today. Unfortunately, there will likely be no final resolution between Israel and Palestine in the foreseeable future. The best we can do is spread the word about this issue and make the populace care about global affairs.

"Things you didn’t know about your furnace
At a dinner this week in San Francisco, I found myself seated between Matt Golden, co-founder of energy efficiency retrofitter Recurve — the startup formerly known as Sustainable Spaces — and Cisco DeVries, co-founder of Renewable Funding, the Oakland outfit that pioneered municipal financing of residential solar arrays.
The hot topic was Home Star — aka Cash for Caulkers — the proposed $6 billion federal energy efficiency rebate program now wending its way through Congress. The bill is being cast as a way to fight climate change, lower energy bills for 3.3 million homes and create an estimated 168,000 sustainable green jobs in a recession-wracked nation.
No surprise that a coalition of environmentalists, labor groups, and businesses have hitched their star to Home Star, including Home Depot, Dow Chemical, the Sierra Club, and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
About $3.6 billion of Home Star cash would be devoted to “Silver Star,” a program designed to quickly roll out basic energy efficiency improvements by providing up to $3,000 in rebates per household for such things as insulation and sealing doors and windows.
The Gold Star part of the program offers $3,000 for every 20 percent in energy savings that result from retrofits, up to a maximum of $8,000. Under Gold Star, homeowners could undertake more extensive energy efficiency retrofits as well as install renewable energy systems such as solar arrays.
Both programs would cap the rebates at 50 percent of a project’s cost.
“This program is designed to rapidly create jobs but also a long-term American industry,” Golden said a couple days after the dinner during a press conference held in advance of Congressional hearings Thursday. “We have an opportunity to contribute to energy independence and meet our climate goals. The construction industry is in the realm of a Depression. These are 100 percent American jobs.”
It’s winning rhetoric but what I wanted to know was this: with billions of dollars in federal subsidies potentially flooding the energy efficiency market, how do you ensure that retrofits are done properly and that the climate change dividend gets paid?
Talk to old-timers who lived through various solar subsidy programs back in the 1970s and ’80s and they’ll bemoan the shoddy operators that tried to cash in on the market, giving legitimate companies a bad name.
Golden takes pains to emphasize that Home Star energy efficiency retrofits will be audited to ensure “the American taxpayer is getting their money’s worth.”
The details of those audits remain to be worked out but some high-tech tools could help make sure those caulking guns shoot straight.
Over the past year there’s been a proliferation of home energy management software from companies like Google and Microsoft as well as startups such as AlertMe and Tendril.
New Microsoft Hohm software provides real time data on home energy useThe idea behind services like Microsoft’s Hohm and Google’s PowerMeter is to give homeowners data — in real time for those whose utilities have hooked up smart meters — on their energy use. That way they can pinpoint where they may be wasting electrons, whether through bad habits or electricity-hogging appliances, and adjust their behavior accordingly.
I asked Microsoft executive Troy Batterberry whether Hohm could play a role in Home Star to monitor electricity usage before and after a retrofit and quantify the energy savings from various improvements.
“Absolutely and it’s a question we get from our utility partners,” said Batterberry, who runs the Hohm program. “We’re going to have mountains of data that we can use to verify, say, what the expected savings will be when a person puts in a new high efficiency heat pump or air conditioner.”
“Home Star could ignite the use of this type of tool,” he added.
Such programs could also come in handy in helping retrofit firms identify energy hogs in a home.
Dan Reicher, director of climate change and energy program’s for Google.org — the search giant’s philanthropic arm — discovered that feature of the company’s PowerMeter energy management software when he began using it at his home.
“Literally with PowerMeter, everyone discovers something about their home they didn’t know about,” Reicher told me during a recent visit to Google’s Silicon Valley headquarters. “In my case I had an old gas furnace but decided that given we don’t have a lot of cold weather around here it didn’t make a lot of sense for me to replace it. What I didn’t realize was that the furnace had an ancient electric motor.”
Once Reicher started using PowerMeter he began to notice spikes in his home’s electricity usage every time the furnace came on. After some investigation he discovered the culprit was the old inefficient motor that pushed hot air through the house’s ductwork.
Such data could help make those Home Star dollars go even further by providing at least a partial roadmap of a home’s energy efficiency weak spots before the guys and gals with the caulking guns show up at the front door. And assure taxpayers that their dollars are well spent.

This is a series of infographics I designed and illustrated based on the new wearable technology that is available to consumers. 5 different types of professions/people we chosen to illustrate just how much of this Tech is out there and what it could be used for. We tried to get as broad a range as we could to help illustrated this point.
In 2014 I designed a series of posters as a present for my parents, who had just bought a new flat in London. I wanted to depict the new London and it’s evolving skyline. The idea was that these images would age as they lived in the flat. These buildings would change from new London to old London.
These have been featured on a number of blogs including: waaaat?, Feel Design, Sky High City, fubiz and others. They were also featured in a Mexican Design publication called Fahreniheit.
This was a self-initiated project I completed in 2016. The brief was simple, design an app that I would want.
The app itself is a walking tour guide for the breweries in London. Using predetermined tours from the libraries you could navigate you way around London’s many breweries, pubs and beers.
I used this project as an excuse to design an app; something I had always wanted to do. Although I never intended to put it on the app store, I wanted to understand how they were made and learn about UI design. I started with sketched wire-frames and worked it all the way up to the final design. Creating everything for this app was a lot of fun and opened my eyes to new ways of working. Although I have much to learn about app design, I really enjoyed working on this and hope to do more in the future.
On the next few pages are some of the various infographics I have worked on during my time at PHA Media.
I was set the task of designing the Logo and Brand Guidelines for a start up Lifestyle store called Audreystyle. This logo was used as the basis for creating the social media identity and website design.
This is the artwork for a new single called Sky Rocket by Phoebe Ray being released in 2016.
I worked closely with the artist on the project but was give the freedom to explore the song and its lyrics to create the final artwork.
I also created a number of social media posts and profile imagery.
This one of a series of documents called ‘Insights’ I have created while working for PHA Media. Each has a unique topic and associated look. These documents are used to help clients, both current and prospective, understand what PR is and how to make it work in your advantage.
For each I was used different illustrative styles to fit the topic described. This allowed me to try a number of different styles and techniques.
In both 2014 & 2015 I submitted illustrations for the annual Secret 7” completion. In this you are asked to create work based on
one of 7 songs they select.
My work was selected for the final exhibition in both years.
In 2015 I was asked to re-brand Hip Joint Surgery, a Consultant Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeon. For this he required a new logo and website.
I used a subtle curve on the H in Hip to imply the shape of the hips and took the clean style right across the brand. This lead on to designing the website where we had to make the functionality simple for his elder clients as well as attract new ones.
This was my submission for the Catit art competition in 2015. I won the Digital category.
Having just got my own first cat I wanted to create a piece that would show the joy and love of cats without being trite.
I was asked in 2015 to come up with a logo for Homeland Events who run a number of skiing based events here in the UK, including ski film premières.
As an avid skier myself, I wanted to recreate the joy that comes from skiing but also take you to the top of a mountain, which is where all good ski stories start.
These are some of my other illustrations I have designed over the past few years.
This is a collection of some of my favourite print work I created whilst working for MARIS. I produced all their pitch and technical documents during the year I worked there. These were usually tailored to the client. Most were restricted by the client’s marketing identity, but some were broader briefs which allowed my to play with a number of different styles.
These documents often had to contain a large amount of technical data and it was my job to make the information clear and understandable to the client, whilst holding their attention.
A collection of my student work
In 2015 I designed and created the new website for Swordfish Investments LLP. They wanted a modern and elegant site that was in keeping with the new offices they were designing at that time. I used imagery from around Berkeley Square near their new offices.",What was the purpose of the app designed in 2016?,"The app was a walking tour guide for the breweries in London, designed to help users navigate around London’s many breweries, pubs and beers."

We present a cheap multilevel solver for partition of unity discretizations of any order. The shape functions of a PUM are products of piecewise rational partition of unity (PU) functions and higher order local approximation functions (usually a local polynomial. Furthermore, they are non-interpolatory. In a multilevel approach we not only have to cope with non-interpolatory basis functions but also with a sequence of nonnested spaces due to the meshfree construction. Hence, injection or interpolatory interlevel transfer operators are not available for our multilevel PUM. Therefore, the remaining natural choice for the prolongation operators are L2-projections. Here, we exploit the partition of unity construction of the function spaces and a hierarchical construction of the PU itself to localize the corresponding projection problem. This significantly reduces the computational costs associated with the setup and the application of the interlevel transfer operators. The second main ingredient for our multilevel solver is the use of a block-smoother to treat the local approximation functions simultaneously. The results of our numerical experiments in two and three dimensions show that the convergence rate of the proposed multilevel solver is independent of the number of patches. The convergence rate is slightly dependent on the local approximation orders.} }",What is the main focus of the paper written by M. Griebel and M. A.

"Amél. This leads her to invent all sorts of strategies to intervene in the existence of the people around her. Among them the concierge who spends her day sipping port while communing with a stuffed dog; Georgette, the hypochondriac newsdealer; and the “glass man”, Amélie’s neighbor who lives vicariously through a Renoir reproduction. Amélie’s mission is rudely interrupted when she meets a strange, off-beat young man, Nino Quincampoix. Nino works shift jobs on a ghost train and in a sex shop, and collects photos littering the ground outside automatic photo booths. He’s desperately trying to identify the stranger whose photo keeps turning up, when his search is suddenly interrupted by his encounter with Amélie. Although fascinated by him, she plays hide-and-seek games, afraid of really opening up to this appealing young man. After several attempts at getting more serious, she takes to her heels. Fortunately the “glass man”, himself an expert on withdrawal, repays her in kind for all she’s done for him by pushing her into Nino’s arms.

"Duke.
Under the so-called ""special consent order,"" Duke will pay $4,000 each for 21 seeps at the three plants. And it agrees to finish draining the plants' coal ash ponds within the next few years - Rogers by March 31, 2020; Allen by June 30, 2020 and Marshall by March 31, 2021. Under state law, Duke has until 2029 to close coal ash basins at the three plants.
DEQ says the fine is comparable to those issued for similar violations, such as those at the Riverbend plant in Mount Holly.
'PAVES THE WAY' FOR CLOSURE
A Duke spokeswoman says the deal removes a key barrier to closing the sites.
""The Special Order by Consent provides clarity on how natural or un-engineered seeps from ash basins will be monitored and it paves the way for the state to issue nearly a dozen permits that the company must have before it can continue to de-water [drain] and close ash basins,"" Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said Tuesday.
The agreement doesn't cover what are called ""engineered seeps,"" which are allowed under other permits. It also says Duke can't be fined for new seeps discovered after Dec. 31, 2014.
DEQ and Duke say they expect to reach similar agreements for eight more coal plants in the state.
Duke already has the permits it needs for three of its 14 plants - Riverbend in Mount Holly, Sutton in Wilmington, and the Dan River plant in Rockingham County.
The agreement must be approved by the state Environmental Management Commission. The DEQ is accepting public comments by mail from Wednesday through Feb. 14. A public hearing is planned Feb. 13, at 6 p.m., at the Warren Citizen Center in Lincolnton.

"The Internet of Things (IoT) wave will soon wash over Australia’s small to medium enterprises.
The Internet of Things, or IoT, is basically the idea of making non-connected devices in our environment connected to us, or each other. For two generations we’ve worked with computers using screens and keyboards, but the future where it involves IoT leaves that paradigm. Smart and connected devices don’t require screens to talk to us, or to each other.
In the early days of computing, people like Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were “makers”, using technologies the Altair 8800 to make computing software, and CPUs like the Intel 8080 to make computer-enabled electronics.
After two to three decades of “doing” using mass-produced and general-purpose hardware and software, “making” is happening again with low-cost access to the Internet, WiFi, and computing with ready-made micro-computers such as the Raspberry Pi, C.H.I.P, Intel Edison, and the cloudBit.
With less than $100, you or I can add connected computing technology to something that was previously unconnected, like a doorbell.
Depending on where you position yourself and your business, that could be a wave of opportunity, a wave of data, a wave of disruption or a wave of security breaches.
Along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology, IoT threatens to shake up our world much like the Internet did between 1996 and 2009, where new jobs were born, many made redundant, and start-ups like Facebook, Google and Twitter emerged from dorm rooms and basements into world mega-companies.
As a distant projection we can imagine nanobots who “live” in your clothes that can repair your wear and tear, change the colour of the cloth and even modify your clothes according to the data of your scales/health monitors. As with anything in our world however, cost is the main driver and in the SME world it will be the small things that make a big difference that will change first.
An example of a likely use in SMEs would be fleet cars/trucks. Already available through Satellite tech, we may soon see the technology become cheaper using the Internet and having our cars join the Internet of Things. Or perhaps the fuel tanks of our fleet cars, or their safety cams.
At this point, as a SME owner I could learn a lot about how my company cars are being used, where they are going and get indicators of how long they will last or how regularly they need to be serviced. As a tool manufacturer, my plant equipment can inform me when a part is about to fail or requires service. As a café owner, my storage tubs could report when a threshold of bacteria has been reached, requiring food to be tossed out ahead of schedule.
IoT will start where it’s cheap to implement and provides maximum benefit, and gradually backfill through our world to where it becomes ubiquitous. If it hasn’t already struck you, the security implications are monstrous.
It would be nice to have my PC hard drive IoT enabled, to report to me or my backup software that it predicts a failure in itself. Of course, an IoT hard drive is connected to the Internet, putting all of my data at risk. What would be at risk if my insurance company, my government, other governments, criminal gangs or my former partners could access everything on my hard drive?
Thankfully those behind IoT are thinking ahead, and trying to create IoT “things” that have “baked-in” security, national or international standards of a sliding scale so people can make informed decisions without an in-depth technical knowledge of IT and IoT security.
The other mind-bending change coming from IoT is data. The amount of data we’re likely to produce in the next two decades will be exponentially more than in previous history. Big Data is going to get really big now, as millions, then billions of “things” around the world begin to report to millions of databases.
So where does Diamond fit into all of this?
The closest thing we sell to IoT right now is smart phones. Our iPhones and Android phones are early examples of IoT, although true IoT of the future will be mostly without a display or human interface. One key area of security relating to IoT is already valid.
The big change coming that relates to Diamond is the security of outgoing data. One of the main advantages of modern Unified Threat Management devices (UTM) is that they are capable of monitoring where traffic is going, where it came from and what’s in the data. In the past much of the data from SMEs has been coming in, but IoT will further increase the traffic going out, and it will need to be protected, restricted and monitored.
A UTM is already useful for monitoring people, applications and potential threats from PCs and servers and smart phones, and will become a necessity going forward as IoT becomes commonplace.
We have a fascinating future ahead of us with these emerging techs, perhaps the biggest explosion of knowledge the world is yet to see. The security and privacy challenges ahead of us are huge, but we humans will adapt and learn as we always have and see some mind-boggling changes in our lifetime..",What is the Internet of Things (IoT) and how might it impact small to medium enterprises in Australia?,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of making non-connected devices in our environment connected to us, or each other. It is expected to soon have a significant impact on Australia’s small to medium enterprises. This could present opportunities, data, disruption, or security breaches, depending on the positioning of the business. For example, IoT could allow a business owner to learn more about how their company cars are being used, or a café owner could be alerted when a threshold of bacteria has been reached in their storage tubs. However, it also presents security implications, as connected devices could potentially put data at risk."

"It’s not an easy decision to take off your best-selling product from the market and replace it with the one that has no parallel. That’s exactly what Toyota did in February 2005 by discontinuing the Qualis multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) and launching a bigger, more luxurious MPV, the Innova.
From Qualis to Innova
The Qualis was introduced in January 2000, and by the time the company discontinued this rather ordinary-looking MPV in December 2004, a cumulative 1,42,500 units were sold. According to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, the Qualis—which competed with Tata Sumo and Mahindra Bolero, among others—was instrumental in increasing the market share of the MPV segment in the industry from less than 9% to over 11%.
Sales averaged over 2,000 units per month and, contrary to popular perception, only 30% sales went to the taxicab segment. The decision to launch the Innova—MPVs were all about ‘value’, the Innova introduced ‘luxury’ in the segment—was part of an international project to develop a single platform on which new models will be built.
From 2005 to 2016
Launched in February 2005, the Innova was a runaway success, even at then what was a hefty price tag for an MPV—from Rs 6.75 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. Toyota sold 5,78,014 units in 11 years—averaging over 4,000 units every month. What competitors didn’t quite understand was how could a brand maintain its appeal for over a decade without the manufacturer making too many changes to it. A few improvements Toyota introduced were the addition of an intercooler (2009), a minor facelift (2011), and a second minor facelift (2014).
Harish Bijoor, brand expert & founder, Harish Bijoor Consults, says that the strong brand value of the Innova is courtesy its Indianness. “In many ways, the Innova is a ‘made for India’ car. It’s big, rugged and spacious. It’s a ‘two plus two plus two car’, as I would call it,” he says, adding that it was finally a replacement for the long-dying Ambassador. “It took on the legacy of the Ambassador. The bureaucracy adopted it just as much as the fleet owners embraced it.”
It did face competition—Mahindra Xylo, Chevrolet Tavera, Nissan Evalia, Renault Lodgy—but none could challenge its dominance. With the Ertiga, Maruti Suzuki managed to outsell the Innova every once in a while, but then the Ertiga was a cheaper, entry-level MPV. Again, contrary to popular perception, the Innova was primarily sold in the personal segment (70%), not commercial—which has higher ‘visibility’, thus the perception.
The Delhi diesel ban
In December 2015, the Supreme Court, in a move to clean up the city’s filthy air, imposed a ban on registration of diesel vehicles of engine capacity 2000cc and above in Delhi NCR, until March 31, 2016. As much as 8% of Innova sales, or 700 units per month, evaporated—it had a 2494cc diesel engine. N Raja, director & senior vice-president, Sales & Marketing, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, says that the company supported local dealers by taking back the inventory and providing salaries to the affected sales staff.
From Innova to Crysta
In May 2016, the company drove in the Innova Crysta, this time with two diesel engine options—the 2393cc with manual transmission and 2755cc with automatic. Price increase was to the tune of a considerable Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 4 lakh and the Delhi diesel ban continued, yet sales shot up. By the time the company launched a petrol version—2694cc—in August, the Innova Crysta already had sold over 24,000 units and had a pending order of 9,000 units. A new sales trend ensued—from the earlier 70% sales that went into the personal segment, it increased to over 95%. Another trend was that 50% of Innova Crysta sales were those of automatic transmission, reflecting the changing customer preference.
Reasons behind success
Raja says it has a low cost of ownership, its engine life is the best in the segment, and resale value is high. “A three-year-old Innova, for example, doesn’t lose more than 30% of its original price when you retail it in the second-hand market.”
Agrees Hormazd Sorabjee, the editor of Autocar India magazine. “In the MPV segment, success is more due to practical considerations than emotional ones. The Innova has an unbeatable reputation for reliability, quality and a strong resale value—the most important criteria for MPV buyers. It also has a 5-lakh-strong customer base and many of them are ready to upgrade to the new Innova—this serves as a ready market that no other MPV has.”
From Crysta to Touring Sport
Earlier this month, Toyota launched yet another variant—the Innova Touring Sport from Rs 17.79 lakh to Rs 22.15 lakh. It gets an all-black front grille, smoked chrome headlamps and front bumper spoiler, giving this MPV an SUV-like styling. For the first time, customers have the choice of a sporty avatar.
Hefty pricing hasn’t slowed down sales. In one year, the Innova Crysta has sold 85,475 units (over 7,000 units every month). Bijoor says it’ll keep scripting new success stories, even though the new pricing has pitted it against entry-luxury cars. “Toyota is investing in nudging the brand image higher in the pecking order, and is evolving the brand as India itself climbs up the hierarchy of needs in its choice of cars.”

"1And before the Festival of the Passover, יהושע knowing that His hour had come that He should move out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
2And supper taking place, the devil having already put it into the heart of Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on, to deliver Him up,
3יהושע, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come from Elohim and was going to Elohim,
4rose from supper and laid aside His garments, and having taken a towel, He girded Himself.
5After that He put water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the taught ones, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
6And so He came to Shim‛on Kĕpha, and he said to Him, “Master, do You wash my feet?”
7יהושע answered and said to him, “You do not know what I am doing now, but you shall know after this.”
8Kĕpha said to Him, “By no means shall You wash my feet, ever!” יהושע answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.”
9Shim‛on Kĕpha said to Him, “Master, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”
10יהושע said to him, “He who has had a bath does not need to wash, except his feet, but is clean altogether. And you are clean, but not all of you.”
11For He knew who would deliver Him up, so He said, “You are not all clean.”
12When יהושע had said this He was troubled in spirit, and witnessed and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you shall deliver Me up.”
22The taught ones looked at one another, doubting of whom He spoke.
23And one of His taught ones, whom יהושע loved, was reclining on the bosom of יהושע.
24Shim‛on Kĕpha then motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke.
25And leaning back on the breast of יהושע he said to Him, “Master, who is it?”
26יהושע answered, “It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.” And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on.
27And after the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. יהושע, therefore, said to him, “What you do, do quickly.”
28But no one at the table knew why He said this to him,
29for some were supposing, because Yehuḏah had the bag, that יהושע was saying to him, “Buy what we need for the festival,” or that he should give somewhat to the poor.
30So, having received the piece of bread, he then went out straightaway, and it was night.
31When,Shim‛on Kĕpha said to Him, “Master, where are You going?” יהושע answered him, “Where I am going you are unable to follow Me now, but afterwards you shall follow Me.”
37Kĕpha said to Him, “Master, why am I unable to follow You now? I shall lay down my life for You.”
38יהושע answered him, “Shall you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock shall not crow at all until you have denied Me three times.",Who was going to deliver יהושע up according to the context?,"Yehuḏah from Qerioth, son of Shim‛on, was going to deliver יהושע up."
"The shortcut button has many uses, the most common being to create a “mirror” of an asset on a site. This is similar to a copy and paste; however, by creating a shortcut of an asset, an asset can be duplicated on a site, and editing the properties of one version of the asset will affect all versions of that asset throughout the entire site. So, if you place a shortcut of an article on three locations on a site, editing just one version of that article will render changes on all three.
To
create a shortcut of an asset, locate the asset toolbar of the asset
you’d like to duplicate. In this case, the “Welcome” article of
the WebGUI demo page will be duplicated.
The shortcut button is at the far right hand side of the asset toolbar and resembles a curving arrow.
To create the shortcut, click on the shortcut arrow. A new tab, the Clipboard tab, will appear in the Admin Bar, containing the asset shortcut. The asset’s title will be displayed, so if there are multiple items in the clipboard you will be able to tell what is what.
go to the page on which you’d like to place the copy of the asset.
In this example, a copy of the “Welcome” article will be placed
on a new page layout. Simply click the asset’s title in the
Clipboard and the mirror of the asset will be placed on the page.
In
this example, you can see a duplicate of the “Welcome” article
placed on a new page layout. The asset is identical to the article on
the demo homepage.
Click on the “Edit” button of the original article’s asset toolbar. In the articles “Edit Article” screen, change the article’s content.
Click
save, and you’ll see the new content displayed in the article.
You’ll
also see that exact same content “mirrored” in the asset
shortcut, illustrating that changing the content in one version of
the asset will affect all shortcuts made of that asset.
At times, you may want to create a shortcut of an asset, but you might not want that shortcut to appear exactly like the original. In this case, WebGUI provides the option to override shortcut properties. This will allow you to change the properties of the shortcut, but will not affect the properties of any other version of the shortcut asset on the site.
If you look at the shortcut of the “Welcome” article, you will notice that there are two toolbars: a shortcut toolbar and the asset toolbar. The shortcut toolbar is the upper toolbar, above the gray bar with the “Shortcut” heading; hovering your mouse over the furthest icon to the left will reveal this.
To illustrate override options, a shortcut of a news section will be made. A Collaboration System formatted as a Weblog was added to a web page, and then used as a news story section.
As you can see, the original news story section contains eight stories. The creator of this asset would like a shortcut of the news section to appear on the site’s homepage, but only wants four of the threads to be visible on the homepage, as opposed to the full eight. In this case, an override of the asset’s original properties will be made in the shortcut.
In
this example, the shortcut of the news section will be place below
the “Welcome” article of the Plain Black demo homepage.
All
eight headlines are currently displayed in the asset shortcut, and
the desired outcome is to only display 4 of those threads on the
page. To change this, the properties of the shortcut will need to be
overridden. To do so, locate the shortcut toolbar, and click its Edit
button. This will open the “Edit Shortcut” screen.
Click
on the “Overrides” tab to open the override screen. On this
screen you will see a list of asset properties that may be edited.
This screen varies depending on the type of asset that was made into
a shortcut.
Locate
the “threadsPerPage” property and click on the “Edit” button
to its right. This will open a screen from which the original
property value can be changed. In this case, the original value was
30, and it is being changed to 4. After the new value is entered
click save.
You
will be returned to the “Manage Shortcut Overrides” screen on
which will be reflected the property you just edited.
Return
to the site, and you will see that the shortcut on the homepage now
displays only four threads.
However, all eight threads are still displayed on the News page containing the original asset.

"Chapter 1
Loren was sitting at the coffee shop on her break when Mel, he best friend walked in.
""You know what today is?""
""Buy one donut get one free day?"" Loren smiled.
""Oh come on, I know you're excited about you're 3 month anniversary with Cam!""
Loren smiled, ""He's taking me out to dinner at 6, and then we're going to the fair.""""Ugh so romantic. Make sure you pay the guy to stop the Ferris wheel when you guys are at the top.""
Loren laughed, ""I just can't believe it's been 3 months!""
""I know I thought you would have dumped him for Eddie when Eddie dumped Chloe.""
""No, Eddie and I are just friends.""""Hard to believe we tried to sneak into his concert""
""I know we were crazy fan girls weren't we?""
They laughed and talked until Adam came in and Loren had to go back to work. About an hour later Loren was making herself a coffee to go when Cam scared her.
""HEY!"" he said creeping up behind her. She spilled her, thankfully iced, coffee down her shirt and pants, ruining them completely.
""Cam!""
""Sorry babe."" He kissed her as she came out from behind the counter getting ready to end her shift.
""What's up?""
""Just wanted to be positive we're on after my practice.""
""Wouldn't miss it for the world. I have to go change. But I'll see you after my session with Eddie""
""Alright see you then"" Cam said as he walked Loren to her car.
She started the car and texted Eddie. 'Gonna be a little late. I have to change my clothes.'
She drove home to an empty house. Her mom left her a note on the wall.
'Out with Don. Be gone till late xoxox Mom'
Loren sneered. She hated her mom dating Don Masters. Not only because he is Adriana's dad but because she could tell there was something not right with him. He's a player, she can feel it. She crumpled the paper and threw it in the trash. Her phone vibrated, Eddie texted her back. 'Hurry here; songwriting isn't fun unless you're here '
She smiled and got ready to meet Eddie.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Eddie was sitting at his and Loren's spot. They tried writing songs in a studio, at the club and everywhere really but here is where their minds really click. They've written 3 songs now and Eddie was ecstatic. With Loren's help, his record label was getting what they wanted and he was having fun writing songs. He saw her walk up with foam cooler. That was their deal; he brings the guitar, she brings the food. He quickly checked his breath and stood up to take the cooler from her.
""Hey Loren,"" he said hugging her, ""have fun at work?""
""Yeah because I love dealing with stuck up rich kids from school and smelling like coffee all the time."" They laughed.
""You smell fine. Ready to get started?""
""Yeah, but I have to leave early today."" She said sitting down.
""What why?""
""Well, tonight is my 3 month anniversary with Cam.""
""Oh, okay."" He didn't know why but this really bothered him. He didn't like Cam. Something about him just rubbed him the wrong way and he would be damned to see him hurt Loren.
For the next few hours they laughed and wrote lyrics to their new song. It seemed like 10 minutes went by when Melissa called Loren.
""Hey Mel you're on speaker""
""WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?""
""I'm songwriting with Eddie why?""
""It's 5:00! You were supposed to be here half an hour ago!""
""Shit, I'll be there in 5 minutes.""
She hung up the phone and picked up her stuff, ""This was fun Eddie. See you tomorrow?""
""Yeah have fun on your date."" He said with a half smile. He watched her walk away and wished she would stay. He looked out and saw the sun start to set.
'Why does this bother me so much?' he thought.
He picked up his car keys and drove to his dad's club. He needed to talk to someone.
""Hey Eddie"" Max said ad Eddie walked in the door.
""Hey, pop"" Eddie said, ""I need to talk to you."" With that Eddie said everything on his mind. When he was finished his dad was smiling at him with an eyebrow raised.
""Son, you're jealous"" Max said.
""No dad, she's just a friend.""
""Please, you always talk about her, want to spend time with her. You hate it when she's with any other guy. She's been there for you since you and Chloe broke up. It's normal that you developed feelings.""
Eddies looked at his dad, ""Shit"" he said. His dad handed him a beer and his phone vibrated.
""Loren just tweeted a photo of her and Cameron at the top of the Ferris wheel."" He said turning his phone off.
""Go home son, it's late."" Max said putting a hand on Eddie's back. Eddie left the club and went home. He laid down in his bed and thought about what Max said. It was the complete truth.
'I can't try and take her from Cameron, she really likes him. But I'm better than that guy. He doesn't deserve her. No, she's happy I won't do this to her.' Eddie rolled onto his side and tried to fall asleep. 'Just keep your mouth shut, Duran' he told himself as he drifted into a dreamless sleep.

"Miguel Hidalgo, Mexican Independence
Miguel Hidalgo is one of the most recognized characters in the movement for Mexicos Independence. His full name was Miguel Gregorio Antonio Ignacio Hidalgo y Costilla y Gallaga Mondarte, born in Guanajuato in the town of Penjamo on the 8 of May, 1753. His parents were Ana Maria Gallaga and Cristobal Hidalgo y Costilla, both Spanish.
He studied at Colegio de San Nicolas Obispo, where he continued to become a professor on topics like philosophy and theology, culminating with theSchools rectory. He was ordained in 1792 and sent to Dolores Hidalgo.
Back then, the ideas of liberalism had permeated among the Creole class of New Spain, movement joined by the priest of Dolores and consolidating in the conspiracy of Querétaro struggling for Mexicos independence.
This is how one of the most important episodes in the countrys history began, although many other characters have remained almost anonymous even though they contributed resources and organization in support of the movement,Hidalgo is recognized for having reacted together with others such as Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama and Mariano Abasolo, among others, to the call of Doña Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez who warned that the conspiracy had been discovered.
This is how, with the power to call others, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla on the morning of September 15 in 1810 summoned the town to start the movement that would give Mexico its independence, even though he didnt live to see its culmination.
The movements first advance, however, is owed to Hidalgo and military men, their troops left Dolores, reached Atotonilco in San Miguel de Allende, then known as El Grande, directing towards Celaya, Salamanca and finally Guanajuato.
At the Alhóndiga de Granaditas there was another confrontation between the Spanish and insurgent troops, the first were defeated, so Miguel Hidalgo went on to Valladolid, which was also among the most important places taken back then. Valladolid is important because thats where they planned overtaking the Capital of New Spain, where all the central powers were represented.
Along his path, on August 30 in 1810, the battle of Monte de las Cruces took place, already close to the capital, where he was triumphant, however, this gave Hidalgo an excess confidence and sent his troops to Ixtlahuaca, wasting the weakness he had left in the city.
His plan was to attack the realist troops by surprise and to not confront them in the capital, which lead to a confrontation at Puente Calderón, where he didnt gain an advantage, returning to the countrys north. Along his path, at Acatita de Bajan, he and his troops suffered an ambush because their route had been announced to realist troops, making them prisoners.
The date of his detention was registered in history as the 21st of May in 1811, when they were taken to Chihuahua, where they would first execute Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama and Mario Jimenez, on June 16 of that same year. Hidalgo was executed later, on July 30 of 1811. However, the struggles and ideals of the leaders were not forgotten and although their armed battle culminated in 1821, the figure of the Priest of Dolores continues to be transcendental for its meaning and the way he strengthened the struggle for independence.
For many, Hidalgo wasnt the historys hero known by almost everyone, however, and despite his detractors, for Mexicans the leaders who made independence possible are kept away from critics and secret history; they are venerated for the great value of freedom in an independent country.

"Moody’s: Gov’t sale of UCPB stake ‘credit positive’
The sale of the government’s majority stake in United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) will improve the lender’s capitalization and credit quality moving forward, debt watcher Moody’s Corp. said on Thursday.
“A successful privatization of UCPB will help the bank raise new equity capital to meet Basel III capital requirements, a credit positive. And, if a larger bank acquires UCPB, we expect that UCPB’s credit quality would benefit from the support of its new majority shareholder,” Moody’s said in a statement.
Last week, Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III disclosed that the Department of Finance (DOF) will soon start privatizing UCPB, after the Supreme Court (SC) lifted this month the halt order it had issued to implement Executive Order (EO) No. 180 signed by former president Benigno Aquino III.
To recall, the SC put on hold in June 2015 the implementation of EO Nos. 179 and 180, which would have set into motion the privatization and reconveyance to the government of about P74.3 billion in coco levy funds that the high court earlier declared as public funds.
According to Moody’s, “if the privatization and recapitalization are successful, the new equity capital will support UCPB’s growth and maintain its minimum Tier 1 capital ratio above a 10-percent requirement that includes a capital conservation buffer required for all Philippine banks.”
Also, Moody’s noted that “in contrast to the government, UCPB’s eventual new majority shareholder likely will view UCPB as a strategic addition to its domestic operations.”
As such, Moody’s said it expects that “the new shareholder will support UCPB, a credit positive for UCPB’s depositors and creditors.”
“Although no details have been released by either the government or the bank, we expect the terms of the recapitalization plan by first-quarter 2018, shortly after the government and the bank restart the planning work that was done during the last privatization attempt,” Moddy’s said.
“Mr. Dominguez said that the recapitalization program for UCPB should be pursued quickly because the government does not intend to extend the financial assistance for the bank beyond the expiration of the rehabilitation plan at the end of 2018,” it added.

The Statement about the definition of a democracy is from a U.S. government tech manual from 1928 as stated. I have had a degree in government since 1967 from St. Michael's college and was personal protection for a MOH awarded Chaplain for action during the 1968 Tet Offensive. I was subsequently assigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center as a Chaplain's Assistant again and worked the 30 wards (combat traumatic amputees) and also presented the flag to bereaved families as the Chaplain read the Letter of Condolence from the DOD.I had the unfortunate duty as well to deal directly with a number of congress cretins who took their care at Walter Reed and , rest assured: It was a revelation!. I have been a hard conservative ever since and a strict Constitutionalist , having put my money and personal health at severe risk as a matter of my CITIZENSHIP. Most in Washington are concerned ONLY with themselves or their party agendas and rarely if ever, pay much attention to their constituents' wants , needs or preferences. That was my heartfelt conclusion after dealing for 18 consecutive months with them. I see no reason to change that assessment as their proclivities for self aggrandizement and a refusal to compromise for the benefit of AMERICAN CITIZENS is quite apparent if one is honest enough to look at the reality, which too many are not. We are paying the price for THAT lack of vigilance and our failure to hold them either responsible or accountable and, that will continue unless the new Congress can begin a return to CONSTITUTIONAL CMPLIANCE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, so long absent from a government gone rogue. God help, us all and our progeny who, if we cannot turn things around, will suffer incredibly and it is a legacy I would do anything NOT to leave them. Let us hope we can, somehow

That definition of democracy was stated as policy by the U,.S. Government in 1928. It was written when we still HAD a Constitutional Republic which worked because the Constitution was ADHERED TO most of the time. The abuses allowed by a criminally complicit congress MUST eventually lead to a confrontation and we are being deliberately divided from within by the enemies within who are as legion as those from outside simply because they have been allowed to invade us through inequitable or totally lacking ENFORCEMENT of existing American Laws by those in BOTH parties. RINOS are counterfeit democrats and THAT is the problem. True conservatives are the only hope for the country and I wish I were younger for what I fear is coming but, while there is no organized resistance as yet, I am prepared to do whatever I can to Protect and preserve all I have and all that let me have it. I will be neither victimized nor intimidated by swamp things like those who fail to exhibit any sense of decorum. Their idiocy speaks for itself and you KNOW who they are .

"I have always been blaming STRESS for causing havoc to my used-to-be flawless skin. on serious recalling, I have been constantly battling with this acne for the past one year. Oh gosh! The thought of it made me fumed! I thought acne only occurs in adolescent and not adults?
Recently with the results of my cleanser's pH testing, it made me wonder why the huge variant in pH readings between Ettusais Medicated Soap (pH9) and The Body Shop Tea Tree Facial Wash (pH6) which I have been diligently using for the pass 6 months.
I usually uses TBS Tea Tree Facial Wash for morning, as I find it less harsh and more moisturising. As for Ettusais Medicated Soap, it for use at night, right after proper cleansing oil method. Somehow the Ettusais manages to leave my skin real clean but rather drying which I quickly hydrate with my Vichy Thermal Facial Mist (I am horrified that it has a pH9, which I will be discussing more in my next post). Its really horrible to think of how much my skin has to recover to pH5.5 after using the Ettusais Medicated Soap. And it made me realised now, how important it is to apply the Ettusais Acne Version Up (pH6) and Ettusais Acne Aqua Shooter (pH5) immediately instead of Vichy Thermal Facial Mist! I cant imagine the amount of bacteria multiplying on my face! Oh yucks!!!
I came across Beauty Credit skin shower story promoting cleansers with pH8.8. This really confuses and contradict my previous findings from ezinearticles.com
Something caught my eye while my brain is trying to logic it out. Cleansers with pH < 5.5 is moisturising but poor cleansing power. Didn't I just review the TBS Tea Tree Facial Wash, commenting that it was less harsh and very moisturising? The main reason why I hate to use it after makeup removal is because it leaves a layer of silky feeling which I find it does not cleanses well. But its great to use it in the morning. Next, cleansers with pH > 8.8 has stronf cleansing power yet causes dryness. Yes! That is exactly what Ettusais Medicated Soap did! It made my skin so dry that prompted me use facial mist.
Despite the table of benefit on cleanser with pH8.8, I seriously need to test it before I can say it works! I am very tempted to buy it yet rather hesitant about cleansers with pH > 8.00. Any advise from readers using Beauty Credit Skin Shower pH8.8? Pls share your review with us by leaving your link at the comments.

There are a lot of views on skincare, just like the age-old argument about moisturisers and oily skin. Some believe that you should reduce or even do away with moisturisers if you have oily skin, while others claim that you need to moisturise more so that your skin won't need to produce more oil to do the job.
For the pH level issue, Somang Korea figured that it's pointless to have a super-gentle cleanser that sacrifices cleaning power. Somang can't claim that pH 8.8 is the ""best"" pH level, but based on their research it is the most ""balanced"" when tested on a majority of people.
My advice is the same for anyone who asks me if such-and-such skincare is right for them - try it yourself first. We have testers available for (almost) every product at all our stores, and some we even have sample sachets for you to try at home. Please check with our staff for availability first, though. - Beauty Credit",What are the pH levels of the Ettusais Medicated Soap and The Body Shop Tea Tree Facial Wash that the author has been using?,The Ettusais Medicated Soap has a pH level of 9 and The Body Shop Tea Tree Facial Wash has a pH level of 6.

"I work in a pretty busy restaurant, and there are tons of managers, everybody’s in charge of me. “Rob, come over here and do this,” or, “Rob, go over there and do that,” and whatever, that’s my job description I guess, server, servant, and I can already hear the, “If you don’t like it, get another job,” rebuttals, which is fair enough, I mean, I could always just leave. But I’ve left restaurant jobs before, it’s always such a pain in the ass showing up at a new place, trying to make a good first impression, starting over somewhere else from the bottom.
And yeah, I don’t necessarily like complaining, but every once in a while it’ll just build up, all of those little interactions at work, constantly getting micromanaged by people that you see every day, only at work, this cast of characters in my life that serve no other purpose than to direct me from point A to point B.
I have a lot of energy. At work, I don’t even necessarily try, but I move around the restaurant pretty quickly. Some kitchen manager will ask me to grab a stack of plates and move it from here to there, and I’ll do it, I get it done without breaking a sweat. And that’s doesn’t even really bother me. It’s when these little orders and commands start to pile up, when I feel that, regardless of how fast I get something done, there’s no end to little chores and constant directions.
“Rob, go get me a stack of plates. Rob, go fold this pile of linens. Rob, get me another roll of printer paper.” After a while I start to feel like, the faster and more efficient that I complete every one of these little tasks, all I’m doing is making more work for myself. Restaurant bosses hate to see their employees standing idle for even a second. And so, as soon as I open up my mouth to start small-talk with a coworker, a manager is guaranteed to show up, to interrupt me midsentence, “Rob, can you make sure that the silverware is polished?”
Yeah, I get the argument that there’s virtue in work. Sure, I have this picture in my head of me marching around the world putting my best foot forward, giving everything that I do one hundred percent, just for the sake of giving it my all, a testament to my admirable work ethic.
But on a day-to-day basis, especially on days where I’m not really feeling it, where I wish that I didn’t have to still be waiting tables at a restaurant, running around, the expediter is telling me to back up ice, and on the way to the ice machine, a customer stops me in my tracks, he lifts up his soda glass and, in between bites of food, he says simply, “More Diet Coke,” and on my way to get his refill, I’ve got another two people in the kitchen looking directly at me, “Is anybody backing up ice?” obviously you just asked me to back up ice, obviously I don’t have the ice, why are you forming it as this general question? Why don’t you just give me a second and I’ll back up ice?
Yeah, on days like that, it’ll get to me, the ceaseless busy work, the realization that, the faster I move, the more work I’ll ultimately have to do. And for what? A few dollars an hour? That’s what really bugs me about restaurant work. The house isn’t even paying me a living wage, and yet they’re acting under the expectation that I’m to work under their absolute obedience, the customers’ absolute obedience, everybody in the restaurant is my boss, but the only ones contributing to my making a living are the people who, after they’ve settled up with the house, maybe they’ll throw me a tip. Probably. Almost definitely. But still, maybe. There’s always the potential for a maybe not.
And so what can I do? “Boss, I gave table thirteen excellent service, but they didn’t leave a tip.”
“Oh well, better luck next time. Can you throw these boxes away?”
So some days, and I hate doing it, but I’ll drag my feet. It’s super passive aggressive, and I doubt anybody’s really paying attention enough to even realize that I’m upset. But that’s the only real control that I have over my day, to just take it a little easier. Because it’s not like if I work really hard they’re going to let me then chill out for a second. No, it’s right back to work, there are always a million things that need to be done, no way that I’ll be able to do everything, and so I might as well just catch my breath, walk a little slower, try to keep those negative thoughts out of my head, just doing my best to be in a better mood.",What is the main character's job and how does he feel about it?,"The main character's job is a server in a busy restaurant.

If your employer offers an individual 401k retirement plan, you should be contributing to it unless you fall into a very small exception category. The only time I would advise against participating in a company-sponsored 401k plan is if these contributions would interfere with your ability to pay monthly bills or get out of debt. Don’t invest in your future at the expense of your current situation. But if you can afford to make even a small contribution to the plan, go for it. Now that you're considering your personal retirement planning, let's address a crucial question: How much should you contribute to your 401k fund? Is 1% enough? Should it be 5%? Or 10%? Should the amount of your contribution depend on your age? Consider these five key factors.
1. Your Company Match Offer
Many companies will match your 401k contribution up to a certain limit. If possible, contribute at least as much as that limit. This company match is completely free money and you should take advantage of every penny of it. If you don't, you're leaving money on the table. The match limit varies, so check with your company to find out whether or not you are making the most of your 401k investment. Also, make sure you read the fine print: Don't be surprised if your company only matches half of your commitment. Many employers also require a minimum amount of service before their matching contributions are fully vested. If you want to consider contributions that exceed your company match limit, the benefits of your higher percentage contribution begin to drop significantly. At this point, you need to weigh the value of the additional 401k investment against the importance of funding other aspects of your life.
There is a limit on how much pre-tax income you can contribute to your 401k retirement plan. Maximum 401k contribution limits fluctuate from year to year, but currently, the limit set by the IRS is $16,500. Your employer may even opt to set a lower limit than that, and employer limits vary from company to company. I've seen them go as high as 20%, but normally, most companies set it around 10%. Some professionals advise that you should contribute the absolute maximum allowed under this rule. Find out your company's restrictions before you make a decision.
Some say that the younger you are, the more you should contribute to your 401k. In essence, the contributions that you make at a younger age are more valuable than the ones you make as you grow older, thanks to the power of compound interest. However, keep in mind that money contributed to a 401k is less accessible than money invested in say, a Roth IRA account, where you can withdraw your contributions at any time without penalty. At a younger age, you may have greater need to spend money to further your education, buy a home, or make other stage-of-life investments. The value of liquidity is an important factor for you to weigh against the benefit of compound interest. Personally, I think your contribution level should depend more upon your current financial situation than on your age. Your actual income level, your current level of debt, and your plans for upcoming life events (and corresponding need for money) should all play a far greater role in your decision-making process.
Since your 401k contribution percentage has a lot to do with your personal situation, you owe it to yourself to consider your mindset toward your money and risk, and other more subjective factors. There are two schools of thought to consider when determining the right contribution percentage. According to one philosophy, you can begin with a large contribution and scale your percentage back as you see fit. Alternatively, you can start small and raise your percentage as much as you can over time. There are two reasons I prefer the first method. First, it's human nature to set something in motion and then forget about it. When it comes to your 401k, by starting high, you choose to commit a significant portion of your income to your 401k plan and receive the maximum benefit from your company match program. In the event that you never tweak it again, you will not lose out on potential gain because you forgot to ramp up your percentage. Second, while some employers will allow you to change your percentage at any time, others will only allow it at certain times of the year. As a result, if you go with the ""start small"" plan, it might take you a long time to work your way up to your peak percentage because of limits on how often you can change this allocation.
The benefits of a higher contribution are easy to see in purely mathematical terms. I've spent a few minutes with an online 401k contribution calculator to illustrate this point for a sample situation. Here are the parameters:
1. $50K salary
2. Age 35
3. Retirement age of 65
4. 8% return on investment
5. 25% tax bracket
In this example, increasing the contribution by just one percentage point would drop your monthly income by a mere $31, which is about $8 per week. Since you would be lowering your taxable income, your annual tax bill would decrease by about $125. So on an annual basis, roughly one-third of your increased 401k contribution would come right back to you at tax time. Are you ready for the big number? If you continue to make that additional monthly contribution until you retire, those contributions of eight dollars per week could grow to over $56,000, based on the 8% return on your investment. Say that a few times over in your head: fifty-six thousand dollars.
In the end, you can make this decision only after reviewing the facts of your current financial situation. And more importantly, as your life changes, you should reevaluate your contribution accordingly. There may be times in life when you’ll have to lower your percentage, but hopefully there are just as many times when you can raise it or maintain a target level. Take a few minutes out of your day to think about your own 401k. Do you know your percentage contribution or how to change it? It's up to you to plan for your future, and although retirement may seem like it's a long way off, there will come a day when you'll be glad you did.",What factors should be considered when deciding how much to contribute to a 401k retirement plan?,"The factors to consider when deciding how much to contribute to a 401k retirement plan include your company's match offer, the maximum contribution limit set by the IRS and your employer, your age, your current financial situation, and your mindset towards money and risk."

More Mississippi Children On Track at the End of Kindergarten Year
Mississippi, which has made early literacy an educational focal point, has good news to report on test scores for its kindergartners.
The children who started kindergarten in fall 2015 performed better on a test of early literacy compared to the previous year's kindergarten class. The children who were kindergarten students in fall 2014 were the first ones to take the state's new STAR Early Literacy Exam. The test is administered twice to kindergarten students, and is intended to give teachers an idea of what children know once they start school, and what they are able to do as they head to first grade.
In fall 2014, the average score was 501, and it rose to 680 by spring 2015. That's the equivalent of a child starting school recognizing most letters and their sounds, and leaving kindergarten having mastered the alphabet, letter-sound relationships, and simple words. Those students are called ""transitional readers,"" and that's where they are expected to be by the end of kindergarten.
For the most recent test administration, the average kindergarten score was 502 in fall 2015, but it rose to an average of 703 in spring 2016. That score is still in the transitional reader range, but state officials said the faster rate of growth showed that more students were mastering those early-literacy skills.
The target score for all kindergarten students is 681. In spring 2015, about 54 percent of children scored at or above that level. In spring 2016, about 63 percent met the benchmark
The state has been decidedly behind in preparing children for kindergarten for years, but these results suggest that may be changing, said Kim Benton, chief academic officer for the Mississippi Department of Education.
""Our schools' and teachers' focus on literacy is making a significant impact on student learning,"" she said in a statement released on June 16.
Mississippi is one of the newest states to claim a state preschool program, having launched a pilot program in 2014-15, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research, or NIEER, a think tank focused on early education. That year, the state served 4 percent of 4-year-olds, and Head Start served an additional 30 percent, according to NIEER. (Just less than a third, 29 percent, of Mississippi's children, live in poverty.)
It will be interesting to see if any future improvement is attributable to the new program at some point. In the meantime, it seems like plenty of kudos likely belong to the state's kindergarten teachers.

The commission has violated its own guidelines, which it had stated before the High Court in an earlier case. It had listed few individuals who have been declared ineligible by court as eligible candidates despite they have been established to have tampered with the bar code and OMR sheets.
This is not the first such case, in reference to shady administration of TSPSC,” BJP Spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao said in a statement on Tuesday.
The BJP leader said adhocism, tentative scheduling of tests, repeated postponements and cancellations of notifications have become the order of the day at TSPSC.
“BJP strongly recommends revamp of the TSPSC as this body is being mismanaged thoroughly and is exhibiting all signs of a corrupt organization,” he demanded adding that over 5 lakh young men and women in Telangana State were being affected directly by the mismanagement of this recruitment body.
BJP also demanded a probe by a Special Investigative Team to look into the irregularities, nepotism and corruption in TSPSC. It is important that bodies like this function professionally, independently and free of corrupt practices, he said.

B. Traven Jr. here. In my continuing search for the great explorer Percy Fawcett,who is chronicled in David Grann's book, The Lost City of Z (9781400078455) 15.95, I have returned early from the Amazonian rainforest in anticipation of being named as this year's winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Robert Zimmerman ain't got nothing on me. Ha, ha! I have been working all day on my acceptance speech. So here's a preview:
""Thank you, thank you. Oh, you're all too kind. Thank you. Please be seated. Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank my fellow authors who were just as deserving of this award as I am. Haruki Murakami, author of IQ84 (9780307593313) 30.00, which releases on October 25, has been highlighted on several of the Nobel Prize shortlists and certainly will be in the running for this award in the future. Goo, goo, g'joob . . .
Of course there's always Nicholas Sparks. His new title The Best Of Me (9780446547659) 25.99 will be available on October 11. Nicholas, who has been compared to Ernest Hemingway, mostly by himself, would have been just as deserving of this award, too.
Bill O'Reilly, who I have always admired, has recently released a new blockbuster called Killing Lincoln (9780805093070) 28.00. Mr. O'Reilly has been a longtime conspiracy theorist and his eye opening take on Lincoln's assassination has been long overdue. Et tu, Mary Todd?
And how about Neal Stephenson? He could write a thousand-page book on what he had for dinner last night. Reamde (9780061977961) 35.00, his latest doorstop, has been getting the kind of reviews that would make Jonathan Franzen envious. Neal, I'm still working on it, so don't 'ream me.' Ha, ha!
And, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Thomas Pynchon. Sorry Tom, you've become the Susan Lucci of the Nobel Prize. (I'm trying to make this sound like I'm speaking off the cuff.) Oh, and I almost forgot my fellow Michigander Jeffrey Eugenides, who should have won this award a long time ago. His new one The Marriage Plot (9780374203054) 28.00 is on-sale next Tuesday. He is the writer's writer. (I try to start the Brown chant from Lisa Simpson's nightmare.) Brown! Brown! Brown!
Secondly, I would like to thank the Swedish Academy. You have great taste. If I hadn't won this year, I would have thought that there was some kind of conspiracy against me. Ha, ha!

"Authors : Richard Bolden, Morgen Witzel and Nigel Linacre
In this chapter Richard Bolden, Morgen Witzel and Nigel Linacre review some of the key themes emerging in this book and their implications for the ways in which we think about and practice leadership and leadership development. Concepts including negative capability, the social construction of leadership, wicked problems, complexity and boundary spanning leadership are considered in order to illustrate the potential benefits and opportunities of a paradoxical approach to leadership.
Contents
- The elusive nature of leadership
- Changing perspectives on leadership and the nature of problems
- Leading in complex systems
- Finding a way forward in a uncertain world
Questions for reflection and discussion
- In this chapter we have highlighted some of the key themes raised throughout this book. To what extent do you agree with our summary? What have we missed that struck you as important? What are the key points or insights for you and your own professional practice and development as a leader?
- Whilst we do not provide a definitive definition of leadership we recognise that definitions and descriptions can be useful in capturing and communicating key ideas. Take some time to review leadership definitions and quotes online and identify three complementary accounts that resonate with your own views and experience. If you are working in a group, share your thoughts with others and take time to reflect on what your choice of quotes and definitions says about your own values and assumptions.
- In this chapter we distinguish between tame, wicked and critical problems. Take a few minutes to think about the main challenges you face at work (or case study organisation of your choice). Can you identify problems that clearly fall into any of these three categories? What leadership response(s) would each call for?
- Leading across boundaries requires us to be aware of the social identities that are important to us, and those we seek to lead. On a sheet of paper list as many of the social identities that relate to you as possible and do the same for those you seek to lead. Do you notice any significant areas of mismatch? What could be done to help improve the fit between what your followers are looking for and what you represent?
- Leadership requires us to create a path forward in an uncertain and unknowable world. Take time to draw up an action plan detailing what practical steps you could take to help create the future you hope to achieve for yourself and/or your organisation. What support would you need to get there and how can you access this?

"Ah, another of my mo irregularly scheduled posts - my 'weekly' favourites! I have been going crazy for pink nude shades lately, on my face as well as my lips, so this week's favourites reflect that.
Fist up is Essie nail polish in muchi muchi, a cute pale pink shade that I've loved wearing to work lately. I don't own too many Essie polishes due to my undying love for Barry M, but I love this colour and the bottle is already almost half empty.
Next is a lipgloss in the form of Tanya Burr's Aurora, which is a gorgeous dusky pink that adds a nice natural rosy shine to my lips. The applicator on these lip glosses is the perfect shape to coat your lips in, I own two other shades in the range and they are definitely my new favourites!
Another lip product that's made it's way into my favourites is my new Maybelline ColorSensation lipstick in Tantalising Taupe, from the Stripped Nudes collection. The formula of these lipsticks are, in my opinion, superior to most other drugstore lipsticks - they are easily on the same level quality wise as some high end counterparts and for only a fraction of the price! The colour payoff (ugh dat phrase!) is excellent, I can see myself investing in this entire collection eventually! This shade looks particularly good with a smokey eye, and has a dewy sheen finish.
Lastly there is an old favourite that I have rediscovered, the beautiful Autograph Highlighting powder. This is just so pretty to look at, and I have been sweeping it over my cheeks and lightly down my nose - where ever would usually catch the light - and the result is fantastic. This is a product that would probably go unnoticed my many because it is a lesser talked about brand in terms of make up, but I cannot recommend it enough, it's lovely!
Have you tried any of these products? What have you been loving this week? xx
I have Tantalising Taupe and I love it! Maybelline are definitely my favourite high street brand for lipsticks :) xxx Thou Shalt Not Covet
I got a lipgloss from Tanya Burr's collection but I hated the colour. I loved the texture though so I think I'll try another one!
